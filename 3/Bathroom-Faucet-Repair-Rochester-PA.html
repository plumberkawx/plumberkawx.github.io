<p>A check backflow device (DC) is the easiest and most common kind of device. It has 2 check valves in a totally closed body-- two layers of backflow defense. No matter how big the valve is, all DCs are equipped with 1-pound springs that hold the check valves closed during a backflow scenario. When you ultimately test a backflow preventer, those 1-pound springs are what you are testing. The device passes if each check valve holds a differential of 1 pound or more on your backflow gauge. That implies that the check valve is holding shut with a minimum of 1 pound of force. The drawback of a DC is that if the very first line of defense fails and the 2nd line of defense fails (both check valves fail to hold), a backflow circumstance could happen. That is why this kind of valve is not defined for what a water company considers high threat" establishments.</p>
