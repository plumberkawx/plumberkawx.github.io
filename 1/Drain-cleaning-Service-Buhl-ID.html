<h3>Install Water Heater in Buhl Idaho</h2>
<p>Hard water is softened by eliminating the calcium and magnesium it consists of. When difficult water goes through the softening system's resin bed, the calcium and magnesium (solidity) ions are removed through an ion exchange procedure, so just softened water passes through to your house. Once the resin bed fills with firmness ions, it must be regenerated (cleaned up). Salt is normally used in the regeneration process and restores the resin to a "clean" state so the ion exchange process can start once again.</p>
