<p>Lubrication might assist with the placement of some parts within the body of the backflow prevention assembly. Lube does not help the assembly work any better, it is only there to help the service technician assemble the elements into the body without creating damage from friction. The lubricant must be a food grade lube to assure the water system is not infected. Oftentimes the best lubricant is water. The typical use for lubricant in the repair procedure, is on 'rings (not guides). All 'rings ought to be gently oiled to assure they do not roll out of their retainer. Using excessive lube can trigger the backflow prevention assembly to fail or wear out quicker by drawing in dirt and particles or limiting the movement of the part. The appropriate amount of lubricant ought to make the surface area of the 'ring appear wet. You should never see pieces or globs of lubricant.</p>
<p>Iron fouling is another common maintenance problem for water softeners. Although colorless, lowered iron will be gotten rid of by the system, red-oxidized iron (iron that has actually been exposed to air or chlorine) will clog the resin. Filtration prior to softening insures that oxidized iron is not processed in the softener. If the resin has currently been fouled, commercial cleaners are offered. Again, it is a good idea to check the manufacturer's guidelines for special precautions.</p>
