When we are ended up, your hot water heater will be back in good working order, and you can avoid the need for pricey repairs.</p>

Mix about a cup of baking soda with a half-cup of salt, and put down the drain. Let the mix sit for a number of hours, then flush with boiling water. You can duplicate this procedure if it does not work the very first time. We do warm water heaters installations and repairs in Carmel, Fishers and Greenfield, IN, Indianapolis and the surrounding counties.</p>

When the pipes start to wear away, it affects your water supply. Polluted water is a health threat and must be handled quickly. Deterioration can also crack, break, or burst pipes and ruin your walls or floorings. We remedy small leakages without repiping, but if you experience persistent leakage or a slab leak, it may be time for a complete plumbing overhaul.</p>
