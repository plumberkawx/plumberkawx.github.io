<p>Recent Review: Button Plumbing was terrific. They replaced my kitchen faucet and included 2 brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had constantly dripped in the past if I shut off the water under the sink. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were really friendly and got the work done rapidly. The cost was rather reasonable. I will definitely use them for any future plumbing needs. I was very happy with their service.</p>
