<p>Storage centers and surge tanks are typically set up at the terminus of the water conveyance system, usually in between and aqueduct and the distribution water mains. These are facilities developed for the short-term staging of water materials and consist of water towers, tanks, tanks, secondary tanks, and lined ponds. These are best considered flow regulators instead of water storage systems. Since water need varies throughout the day while the pipe flow rates from the water source stay approximately continuous, usage never precisely matches supply. As so for those periods where water flow is higher than demand (normally night-time hours), the excess water supply is securely and cleanly saved for later usage when demand rate surpasses supply (usually throughout the work day, though with some variations from morning to afternoon and night).</p>
