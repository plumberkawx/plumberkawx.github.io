In cases where repairing the pipe and jackhammering are not cost effective, it is possible to just abandon the affected section of pipe and reroute the line through the walls, attics and ceilings. Costing less than a complete repipe, completion outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak once again in the future.
