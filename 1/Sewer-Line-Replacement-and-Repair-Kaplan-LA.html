In cases where fixing the pipe and jackhammering are not cost efficient, it is possible to only desert the affected area of pipe and reroute the line through the attics, ceilings and walls. Costing less than a full repipe, completion result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak once again in the future. We have experienced houses having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can add up in cost very quickly.

<p>Recent Evaluation: Button Plumbing was great. They changed my kitchen faucet and added two brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had actually constantly dripped in the previous if I shut down the water under the sink.

Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were really friendly and got the work done rapidly. The cost was quite affordable. I will definitely utilize them for any future plumbing requirements. I was incredibly pleased with their service.</p>
