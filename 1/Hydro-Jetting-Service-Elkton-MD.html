<p>Will sears install my garbage disposal for me. The easiest backflow prevention device is the barometric loop. This is simply a non-mechanical pipe length forming a loop extending a minimum of 35 feet vertically above the supply of water pipeline. The height is needed to get rid of the ambient atmospheric pressure (at mean sea level) of 34 feet of head (14.6959 psi). A loop of pipe this high avoids a siphon from forming. Its advantages are the simpleness of its style and lack of moving parts. However, it may be unwise in many scenarios to install a pipe section of this length.
