You'll have to take apart the drain and P-trap that runs below the kitchen sink to expose the stub pipe" or stubout" that takes a trip behind the cabinet wall. This is where you place the snake into the pipe till you feel resistance to separate the clog.

<p>Property owners typically ask if a gas water heater or an electric system is more cost-efficient. The response depends upon your house. While gas designs are less costly to run, they do need an existing natural gas line. The cost of an electrical hot water heater is normally lower, but it can be more pricey to run. Electric ranges are likewise easier to install, and unlike gas systems, they are less likely to lose heat. Electrical Failures: Garbage disposals are electrical and mechanical in nature, which is why defective electrical wiring or harmed electrical connections are a typical cause for a system that won't work correctly.</p>
<p>For whole-house repiping, the choice typically boils down to copper or PEX (cross-linked polyethylene). This plastic piping is long lasting and less costly than copper. PEX is simple to install, which means the cost of installation might be low also. There is some threat of the PEX pipe splitting, though this is uncommon. In general, it's an affordable service that will stand the test of time. We frequently recommend this material, though it will depend.</p>
