<p>Water that has been entirely demineralized (such as RO and DI water) is starving for ions. This is what makes demineralized water-- or water in which all TDS have actually been removed-- corrosive. For this reason, WQA advises that common metal pipe and fittings (e.g., copper, galvanized, brass, bronze) should not be used downstream of a RO or DI treatment system.

More pricey gas hot water heater with unique venting systems likewise are available. However they're harder to install, and we will not handle them here.</p>
