<p>The City of Jacksonville Structure Inspection Department has actually needed the installation of backflow preventers on all commercial fire sprinkler service lines, watering lines and potable water lines. Commercial assemblies need to be tested every year. If you are looking to install a new sink garbage disposal system or you are planning to replace an already existing system in your home, here are a few things you might want to put into consideration.</p>

It is essential to turn the inlet shut-off valve on gradually while the downside shut down remains in the closed position.

A lot of backflow prevention assemblies have air bleeds or air screws so that air can be removed from important areas in the assembly. In some models, test cocks can be utilized to remove air from an assembly if they are near the top of the body or in a place where the air will collect.</p>
