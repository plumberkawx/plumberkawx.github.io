A waste disposal unit solves all of those problems, adding benefit. Simply switch on water at the sink and the garbage disposal does the rest - and far more silently than you think. By crushing food waste-- modern-day garbage disposals don't really use blades - it's processed by water treatment centers where the small particulates are quickly removed and developed into strong fertilizer, which, in turn, can be offered to lower the overall costs of treatment.</p>
