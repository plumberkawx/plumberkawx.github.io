Plus, our trademarked Directional Circulation Screen system helps ensure that no resin bead goes unused. Our screens and whole-house dirt and sediment filter likewise safeguard the resin bed, so we don't need to squander space on freeboard" which is the empty area in conventional water softeners that allow a churning of resin throughout regrowth to launch hardness, sediment and dirt.</p>
