<p>Reverse osmosis is the process utilized to purify water utilized for drinking and cooking. The water in our RO system goes through 3 stages. In the prefilter stage, big particles like silt and rust are removed by the filter. Next the water goes through the membrane. Hydrogen and oxygen travel through the pores while liquified solids are caught and gotten rid of. Lastly, the water goes to the holding tank after going through one last stage of filtration to remove any leftover pollutants.</p>
