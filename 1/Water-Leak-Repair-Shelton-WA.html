<p>Leaks are tricky. While the time needed will differ based on the house size and the variety of discovered malfunctions, it's best to set aside up to two hours when you schedule an inspection. There's always the opportunity that your plumber's previous job will run long and postpone the beginning time. If the plumber finishes in 15 minutes, and dashes off to their next appointment, they likely rushed the task (unless you have an extremely small plumbing system). Ask how long the inspection generally takes when you call to schedule your visit.</p>
<p>To help prevent clogs within the tee (an effect of the baffle inside ), some plumbers will link the disposer discharge directly to the tee of an end-outlet continuous waste, rather than use the method laid out above. Because the baffle effectively cuts in half the interior diameter of the tee, it's simple for waste from the disposer to clog it up. When the waste should travel horizontally (down the arm) and then change instructions to fall down the trap, this is particularly true. Having the disposer discharge directly down into the tee enables a direct line to the trap that's reasonably friction-free. In this set-up, a waste arm runs in between the other sink drain and the tee.</p>
