<p>Another drawback of water softening through ion exchange is the possible health danger for individuals on low sodium diet plans. Ion exchange increases the quantity of sodium in water, in order to reduce its mineral content. Typically, this procedure includes 7.5 milligrams of salt per quart of water, depending on how difficult the water was to begin with. Harder water will result in more sodium, as there will be more sodium ions exchanged for mineral ions. For many people, this boost in salt is minor, but if you've been encouraged by a medical professional to follow a rigorous low salt diet plan this increase can pose problems.</p>
