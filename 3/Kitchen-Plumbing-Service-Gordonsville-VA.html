<p>Organic particles, such as grease, hair, or food stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is typically the cause of clogged drains. The most typical method a plumber unclogs P-traps is with a tool called a plumber's snake, cable or drain auger. The tool is carefully inserted down your drain to clear it of buildup. You can try to do this yourself, however this isn't a beginner's Do It Yourself task. If you utilize the tool improperly, you can harm your pipes and cause other leaks - so it deserves it to call somebody who understands the drill.</p>
