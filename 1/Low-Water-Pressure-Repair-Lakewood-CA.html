<h3>Water Leak Detection Tips for Homes at Lakewood CA</h3>
<p>What is hard water? Scientifically speaking, it is water that contains substantial amounts of liquified minerals, specifically calcium and magnesium. As water trickles through rocks, limestone deposits and soil, it picks up these minerals on its journey. Depending upon how long the water takes a trip through the ground before reaching your tap, it can get a great deal of these minerals, making water harder in some areas than others.

<p>Your primary step is to shut off the water. In most cases, you'll have a shutoff valve right beside the toilet coming either through the floor or out of the wall. If you do not have a shutoff, shut off the water system at the main shutoff valve, where water enters your house. This is a great time to add a shutoff valve next to the toilet or replace one that leakages. This is likewise a great time to replace the supply line that feeds your toilet (Picture 6). A flexible supply line enhanced with a metal sleeve costs about $7 in the house centers and hardware shops. Photos 1 - 8 show how to replace the valve. Set the height before you install the valve (Photo 5) if the height of your valve is adjustable. If your valve is a various design from the one we show, examine the instructions. After mounting the valve (Photo 6), link the fill tube (Picture 7).</p>
