<h3>Tips For Finding A Cheap Plumber Gaffney SC</h3>
<p>Warning: If utilized on a water supply where a pump and pressure tank supplies the water (like is utilized on a lot of rural houses that have a well), the PVB might spit water each time the pump turns off. This is since the pressure variations caused by the pump and pressure tank system can cause backflow from the watering system back into the water system. The probability of water spitting, and the quantity of water that spits out, both boost with a longer mainline on the watering system. So if you have 10 feet (3m) of mainline in between the PVB and the farthest valve there is less likely to be water spitting than if you have 500 feet (150m) of mainline pipe. One method to stop, or a minimum of minimize, this water spillage is to install a spring-loaded check valve right after the PVB. The PVB might still spill a little water with the check valve installed, however for the most part it ought to be much less water.</p>
<p>Another downside of water softening through ion exchange is the possible health threat for individuals on low salt diets. Ion exchange increases the amount of sodium in water, in order to decrease its mineral content. Normally, this procedure includes 7.5 milligrams of salt per quart of water, depending on how difficult the water was to start with. More difficult water will result in more sodium, as there will be more sodium ions exchanged for mineral ions. For most people, this increase in sodium is small, but if you've been encouraged by a physician to follow a strict low salt diet plan this increase can present problems.</p>
