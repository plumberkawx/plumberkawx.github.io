<p>Homeowners frequently ask if a gas hot water heater or an electric system is more cost-efficient. The response depends upon your home. While gas models are less expensive to run, they do require an existing gas line. The price tag of an electrical water heater is generally lower, however it can be more costly to operate. Electric varieties are likewise much easier to install, and unlike gas units, they are less most likely to lose heat.

The assembly includes durable, seated shut-off valves and testcocks.</p>
