Roots can become the tiniest crack or gap in your house's drain pipe, where they grow in the nutrient rich environment offered by the sewer. Flat roofs usually have drains spaced out around their border. The drains are linked to vertical pipes that are typically linked to underground horizontal pipes linked to community storm drains. Roto-Rooter can mechanically clean these drains from one end to the other to restore flow and prevent water collection on top of the building's roofing system.</p>
