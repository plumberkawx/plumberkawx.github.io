<p>Siphonage into a pipe system. When there is a reduction in supplied pressure to the water circulation, occurs. The outcome is a backflow where liquid in the pipe segment streams backwards relative to the instructions of the system's water system movement. This opposite flow is normally localized and can result from a loss in upstream pressure from, for instance, physical failure of the pipe wall or its joints. Such physical damage is more typical in smaller pipes subject to car traffic on overlaying roads, vibrations from surrounding heavy equipment operations, settlement of nearby soil or moving structures, the wear and tear of pipe appurtenances such as meters and valves, and so on. The outcome is a total breakage, dislocation or splitting in the pipe that allows water to escape.
