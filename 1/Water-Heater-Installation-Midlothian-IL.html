This really depends upon what condition the rest of the pipes remain in, and how tough the old unit is to remove. Oftentimes, removal will just include an additional $25 to $50 to the total costs, however in some cases the costs might be greater if extra pipes need to also be replaced.</p>

<p>When the elements are positioned back into the body, the backflow prevention assembly is all set to be pressurized. It is very important to turn the inlet shut-off valve on slowly while the downside shut down stays in the closed position. This permits the parts to transfer to their pressurized positions in a precise movement. When the assembly is pressurized, then any accumulated air should be removed from the body. Many backflow prevention assemblies have air bleeds or air screws so that air can be removed from vital locations in the assembly. In some designs, test cocks can be used to remove air from an assembly if they are near the top of the body or in a place where the air will collect.</p>
