<p>Lastly, the most advanced and complex backflow preventer is the minimized pressure zone device. This device includes no less than five independently running valves (two check valves and a differential relief valve sealed off at both ends by water tight valves). Each valve functions as a back up system to the other four. During basic water streams at design pressure, the 2 check valves remain open and the relief valve is closed. The relief valve will spring open if either check valve is clogged and wedged open by debris or if siphonage occurs to the linked service pipeline. To prevent backflow, the downstream check valve will close. Such a advanced and reliable  (if costly) device is best utilized in critical locations where cross contamination might be a direct danger to life and health.</p>
