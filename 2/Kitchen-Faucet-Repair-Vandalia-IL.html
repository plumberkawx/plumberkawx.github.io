These are certainly priorities for a municipality and its homeowners but tough water can negatively affect faucets and devices in a home.

Lubricant does not help the assembly work any much better, it is only there to assist the specialist put together the parts into the body without developing damage from friction. The lube must be a food grade lubricant to guarantee the water system is not polluted. In most cases the very best lubricant is water. The typical use for lubricant in the repair procedure, is on 'rings (not guides). All 'rings must be gently lubricated to ensure they do not roll out of their retainer. The use of too much lube can trigger the backflow prevention assembly to wear or stop working out faster by drawing in dirt and particles or limiting the movement of the element. The correct amount of lubricant need to make the surface area of the 'ring appear wet. You should never ever see portions or globs of lube.</p>
