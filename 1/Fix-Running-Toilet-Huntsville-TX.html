<p>Will sears install my garbage disposal for me. The easiest backflow prevention device is the barometric loop. This is simply a non-mechanical pipe length forming a loop extending a minimum of 35 feet vertically above the water system pipeline. The height is necessary to conquer the ambient air pressure (at mean sea level) of 34 feet of head (14.6959 psi). A loop of pipe this high avoids a siphon from forming. Its benefits are the simpleness of its style and lack of moving parts. However, it might be impractical in lots of situations to install a pipe segment of this length. In addition, a barometric loop will not avoid back pressure from forming as the result of a pump failure.</p>
