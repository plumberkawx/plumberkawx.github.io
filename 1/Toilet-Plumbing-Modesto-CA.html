<p>Unless your bathroom renovation is simply cosmetic in nature, bathroom plumbing might effectively become part of your project requirements. Water goes into the top of the water-softener tank and percolates down through the resin beads. The resin has a negative charge, which attracts the favorably charged minerals in the water (a procedure referred to as, ion exchange). The mineral deposits cling to the resin and the now-softened water exits the softener tank and streams throughout your home. Tankless innovation makes sense.
