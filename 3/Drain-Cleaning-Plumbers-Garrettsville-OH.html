We highly recommend repiping your house during spring or summer so you do not have to stress about freezing temperatures throughout the repiping process if you live in a cold-weather environment. Usually, if the problem is restricted to one sink or shower, drain cleaning is most likely the best option. When more than one drain is sluggish or clogged, it can indicate a larger issue with your plumbing system.
