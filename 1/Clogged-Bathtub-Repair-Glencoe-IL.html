<p>Soda dispensers (post-mix carbonators) use carbonated water mixed under pressure with syrup and water to provide sodas beverages. Many, if not most, water pipes are made from copper. When carbonated water enters into contact with copper it chemically liquifies the copper from the pipe.

The Universal Plumbing Code requires that the authorized backflow prevention for a post-mix carbonator be a minimized pressure backflow assembly (RPZ). Additional requirements: no piping consisting of copper will be set up downstream of the RPZ backflow assemblies providing carbonators.</p>
