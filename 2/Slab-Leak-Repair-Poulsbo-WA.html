If you smell a gas leak in or around your home, there are security precautions you should take to secure yourself, your household and your house. Some jurisdictions likewise permit options to backflow preventers. For example, Philadelphia's water district needs all residential systems supplying dedicated sprinkler heads to have a connection from the lawn sprinkler to the toilet tank that's farthest from the water supply.
