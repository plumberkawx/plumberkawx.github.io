Ion exchange increases the amount of salt in water, in order to decrease its mineral content. Usually, this procedure includes 7.5 milligrams of sodium per quart of water, depending on how difficult the water was to begin with. Harder water will lead to more salt, as there will be more salt ions exchanged for mineral ions. For most people, this boost in sodium is minor, but if you've been encouraged by a doctor to follow a strict low sodium diet plan this increase can position problems.</p>
