<p>Unfortunately, when water is totally stripped of calcium and magnesium to become soft, it frequently ends up being corrosive. Corrosive water causes leaching of copper pipes and faucet components, particularly in locations where water sits for extended periods of time. Although this is not a health concern, it is the main reason for the blue and green discolorations being left in your bathroom and utility room sinks. The majority of residential water heaters cost $150 to $400 for either gas or electric, plus $200 to $450 if you have a plumber install it. More costly gas water heaters with special venting systems also are available. However they're harder to install, and we won't deal with them here.</p>
