<p>When the components are placed back into the body, the backflow prevention assembly is ready to be pressurized. It is necessary to turn the inlet shut-off valve on gradually while the disadvantage shut off stays in the closed position. This permits the parts to relocate to their pressurized positions in an accurate motion. As soon as the assembly is pressurized, then any accumulated air needs to be removed from the body. A lot of backflow prevention assemblies have air bleeds or air screws so that air can be eliminated from critical locations in the assembly. In some designs, test dicks can be utilized to remove air from an assembly if they are near the top of the body or in an area where the air will accumulate.</p>
<p>If you're purchasing a new toilet, you need to know the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the large bulk of toilets, the waste pipe is centered about 12 in. from the wall. But with a couple of models, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To inspect the rough-in, just measure from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. Toilet shopping will be a bit harder if that measurement (plus the thickness of the baseboard) isn't approximately 12 in.. A lot of home centers bring only one or 2 10-in. models and no 14-in. models. If you need to special-order a toilet, be prepared to spend much more. If there's a door near the toilet, also measure how far the bowl extends from the wall. If you are changing a toilet with a standard bowl with an elongated" design, the door might not close.
