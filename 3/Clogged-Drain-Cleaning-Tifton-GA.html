<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to conventional softening systems. Rather than a big, single tank or twin rotating system that has actually been sized to manage peak circulation rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller sized tanks to efficiently get used to your company' flow rates throughout the day. Throughout durations of high flow demand, tanks come on-line to include flow rate capability. Throughout periods of low flow need, tanks go off-line. This brand-new technique to softening is called responsive or progressive circulation innovation, and it's probably the most important development in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
