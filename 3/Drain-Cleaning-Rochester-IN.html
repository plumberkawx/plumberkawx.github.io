<p>Current Review: Button Plumbing was fantastic. If I shut off the water under the sink, they changed my kitchen faucet and included two brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had actually constantly dripped in the past. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were very friendly and got the work done quickly. The cost was rather reasonable. I will definitely use them for any future plumbing requirements. I was very pleased with their service.</p>
