<h3>How To Repair Your Water Heater in Franklinton NC</h3>

Tankless systems last 5-10 years longer than tanked units and need less repairs with time.

<p>Your first step is to shut down the water. In many cases, you'll have a shutoff valve right beside the toilet coming either through the floor or out of the wall. If you don't have a shutoff, turn off the water supply at the main shutoff valve, where water enters your home. This is a good time to add a shutoff valve next to the toilet or replace one that leakages. This is likewise a good time to replace the supply line that feeds your toilet (Photo 6).
