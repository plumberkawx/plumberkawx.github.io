<p>Gas and lp that comes out of the ground is completely odorless. The egg smell connected with gas is a chemical mixed into it so that we can smell it. If you smell a gas leak in or around your home, there are safety precautions you should take to safeguard yourself, your household and your home. Some jurisdictions also enable options to backflow preventers. For example, Philadelphia's water district requires all residential systems supplying dedicated sprinkler heads to have a connection from the lawn sprinkler to the toilet tank that's farthest from the water supply. This removes the need for a backflow preventer, since every time that toilet is flushed, it draws water through the fire line to keep the water fresh.</p>

A downside of this device is that it's far more hard to unblock your toilet were to end up being clogged.</p>
