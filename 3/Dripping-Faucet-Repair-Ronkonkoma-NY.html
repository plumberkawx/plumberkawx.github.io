<h3>What Services Do Plumbers Provide Ronkonkoma NY</h3>
<p>Polybutylene Pipe Repair & Replacement: Polybutylene pipe is gray plastic water system line pipe that was established in the 1970s. It was in fact touted as the pipe of the future. It cost less than copper and was easier to install. Sadly, any home that plumbed with polybutylene is like a ticking time bomb. It is not a concern of if it will leak, but when. A clogged or supported drain pipe is a problem. Sometimes a property owner can unclog a drain with a commercial item or with a plunger. In some cases unclogging a drain takes taking apart the plug and putting a hook to take out hair and gunk. And in some cases even then nothing gets that drain cleared, not even basing on one's head and murmuring necromancies to the drain gods.</p>
