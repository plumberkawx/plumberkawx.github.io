<p>Soft drink dispensers (post-mix carbonators) utilize carbonated water blended under pressure with syrup and water to provide sodas beverages. Numerous, if not most, water pipes are made from copper. When carbonated water comes into contact with copper it chemically liquifies the copper from the pipe.
