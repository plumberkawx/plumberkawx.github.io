The riser needs to be firmly connected to sturdy rebar or wooden stake to add structural stability to the assembly.  The direct connection in between the water meter and the structure plumbing prior to the structure is considerably complete is forbidden unless a check backflow assembly is set up and immediately evaluated to assure it is working.</p>
