Usually, the resin is a natural or artificial, sand-like product covered with favorably charged salt ions. As the calcium and magnesium liquifies into favorably charged ions, an ion exchange environment is created. The water streams through the unit while the resin launches its sodium ions and readily trades them for the calcium and magnesium ions. The water draining of the device is now thought about soft.</p>
