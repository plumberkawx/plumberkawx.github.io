A clogged or backed up drain pipe is an issue. Sometimes a property owner can unclog a drain with a commercial item or with a plunger. Often unclogging a drain takes dismantling the plug and putting a hook to take out hair and gunk. And in some cases even then absolutely nothing gets that drain cleared, not even standing on one's head and whispering incantations to the drain gods.</p>
