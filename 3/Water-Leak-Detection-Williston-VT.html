Since the baffle successfully halves the interior size of the tee, it's easy for waste from the disposer to clog it up. This is specifically true when the waste must take a trip horizontally (down the arm) and after that change direction to drop the trap. Having the disposer discharge directly down into the tee allows for a direct line to the trap that's reasonably friction-free. In this set-up, a waste arm runs in between the other sink drain and the tee.</p>

<p>If you home utilizes a septic system and drain field, you'll need a special garbage disposal. The system must grind the waste even finer to avoid obstructions and allow the tank to be able to drain properly into the leach fields. Once, the gas pipe turns up from the ground (called the riser"), it can continue to be covered, but should then transition to galvanized. I am uncertain why that should be. It is likewise enabled to use black iron if it is most likely covered with a galvanized covering (which is generally a special paint"). When plumbing in their gas meters, PG&E frequently does this.</p>
