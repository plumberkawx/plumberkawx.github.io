The pipes can become brittle, gradually, and may need replacement faster than hoped.

<p>Backflow preventers ought to just be fixed when the information collected from the field test indicates the assembly has deteriorated in its performance listed below the developed minimum standard.

When the backflow preventer stops working to meet this minimum standard, the backflow preventer must be repaired or if needed, replaced. These minimum standards are set at a level that as the backflow prevention assembly starts to weaken in its performance, it can still prevent backflow. The function of a repair is to return the assembly back to its initial factory working specs. This suggests the assembly is repaired so that it can carry out above the minimum requirement.</p>
