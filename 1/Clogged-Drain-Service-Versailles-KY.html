<p>A check backflow device (DC) is the easiest and most typical kind of device. It has two check valves in a completely closed body-- 2 layers of backflow security. No matter how large the valve is, all DCs are geared up with 1-pound springs that hold the check valves closed throughout a backflow scenario. When you ultimately evaluate a backflow preventer, those 1-pound springs are what you are testing. If each check valve holds a differential of 1 pound or more on your backflow gauge, the device passes. That suggests that the check valve is holding shut with a minimum of 1 pound of force. The drawback of a DC is that if the very first line of defense stops working and the second line of defense stops working (both examine valves fail to hold), a backflow situation might happen. That is why this kind of valve is not defined for what a public utility considers high risk" facilities.</p>
