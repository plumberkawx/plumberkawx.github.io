<p>Scrape off the old putty with a plastic putty knife so you do not scratch the sink. Seal the brand-new basket in the sink with plumber's putty as displayed in Picture 4. Plumber's putty can not be used on particular brand-new sinks, but these will be identified to that result. Utilize a non-water-based silicone if you can't use plumber's putty. Excess putty will squeeze out in between the new basket strainer and the sink when you tighten up the locknut in place. Clean it off with a rag or paper towel.
