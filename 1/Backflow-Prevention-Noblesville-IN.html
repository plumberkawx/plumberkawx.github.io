<p>If you find a leak and select a patching job rather of a repiping task, just bear in mind that all the pipes in your home are probably made from the same material and they might be next.

If your plumber's auger line is too brief to reach to the end of the pipe, go as far as you can from the front of the drain, then start at the end of the drain and work backwards.</p>
