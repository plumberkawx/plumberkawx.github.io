When one immediately begins regrowth after including salt to the reservoir, the water softener may not work according to standards. After an approval of strategies has been issued and the assembly has been set up, it must be tested by a certified tester. The designer (or water supplier) is then responsible to certify that the installation was carried out in accordance with approved plans; or explain any modifications or submit "As Built" prepares as proper.</p>
