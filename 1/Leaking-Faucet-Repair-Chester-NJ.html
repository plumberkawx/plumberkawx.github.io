<p>Small Leaks - A leak does not always suggest that your hot water heater's going, it may just be condensation. But it likewise could suggest that your tank welds or pipe fittings are worn. A plumber is needed if this is the case. When the majority of people consider plumbers, they usually call them for pipes issues. The natural gas plumber will have a license that states he or she is licensed to work on and install natural gas lines. House owners should consider whether the plumber has a master plumbing license, which signifies a high degree of experience, credentials and knowledge.</p>
<p>Often a clog can be triggered due to accumulation and grease within the system. If this holds true, snaking the drain won't fix the problem. You might need to check out using a high pressure water system to get rid of the clog. This procedure is a bit more pricey and will cost anywhere from $400-$ 1000, depending upon the severity of the clog. At the time of inspection, be sure to leave all of the gas piping exposed so the inspector can take a look at the whole system.</p>
