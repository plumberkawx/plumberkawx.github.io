I actually received their number for another company that couldn't come soon enough but referred me to Rate Buster's. Bo and company were able to come out within 12 hours to examine and provide me a price quote. They instantly cleared the initial obstruction, permitting the tenants to return from a hotel. Regrettably, upon more examination, there was a considerable obstruction that needed excavation to examine. His group was on site the extremely next day, a Saturday mind you, to begin digging a 9 ′ hole. After fixing this initial problem and setting up a protective liner, it was determined that there was yet another break existed. This happened yet a third time as they worked their way through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
