<h3>The Dreaded Blocked Toilet in Chino CA</h3>
<p>For a fire-sprinkler system to operate, the control valve or valves should stay open and the system should be continuously monitored. Therefore, there is a device on each control valve that either avoids the valve from being closed or sends an alarm when it is closed. This device can be as basic as a locked chain through the control valve that prevents that valve from opening, or an alarm that notifies the fire department when the valve is closed. Some systems utilize both techniques. NFPA 13 refers to all such devices as supervisory gadgets.</p>
<p>Those of us in the industry understand that cross-connection programs in numerous areas have vastly reduced the number of reported occurrences that happen within our water systems. This has at times led to individuals thinking that backflow problems and problems no longer exist or that there might never really have been an issue in the very first location. This thinking can be both unsafe and disadvantageous. Backflow events in water supply are an outcome of changes in pressure within that system.  Every system might not need a minimized pressure concept backflow assembly.  In far too many locations we have an all or nothing technique to backflow defense. We need to look at each installation for the hazard it provides and after that install the appropriate defense.</p>
<p>Atmospheric vacuum breaker. Although you may have numerous atmospheric vacuum breakers on your system, the water will just stream through one of them on its method to the emitters or sprinklers.
