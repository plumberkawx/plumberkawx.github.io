Age-- As we discussed, a 10+ years of age water heater is most likely on its last legs. If you are not sure how old your unit is, you should have the ability to get that information from the identification number on the producer's sticker (normally near the top of the unit). Typically, the first two numbers show the year of your hot water heater.</p>
<p>Loosen the screws on the upper install ring (flange install) enough to push the phone a bit - you'll see a little "snap ring" around the bottom of the sink flange (this ring keeps the mount ring from sliding off the flange). Use a flat-blade screwdriver to pry the ring off, and eliminate the mount ring and upper "protector" ring against the sink. The flange (and associated gasket, if suitable) can now be popped out of the drain hole. Clean the area for the new unit.</p>
<p>Hot water heater repair can sometimes be cost-prohibitive. You'll pay for the needed repairs only to face another problem soon thereafter. Always continue to run water during and after utilizing your disposal. Ideally, flushing it with cold water for 30 seconds after the waste has vanished down the drain. The flywheel is jammed: If the disposal hums when you turn the switch, however it does not grind up food, this means the flywheel is stuck. Try releasing the jam by inserting a hex wrench of the appropriate size into the hole on the bottom of the garbage disposal. Alternately, you can prod the flywheel by sticking a broom deal with (not your fingers!) into the sink.</p>
