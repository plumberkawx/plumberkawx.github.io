It contains an air inlet valve, check seat, and air inlet port.  In fundamental operational use, water pressure presses the seat up and blocks the air inlet.  When the water flow stops, it falls back down to open the air inlet port and breaks the vacuum, enabling the device to drain in addition to avoiding back siphonage.  The word siphonage" is very crucial here.  This device just breaks the vacuum to drain water and will not protect against back pressure.
