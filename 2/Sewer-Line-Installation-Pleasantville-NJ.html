<p>Sewer lines have one important function: carry wastewater out of a house or building. When it's time to install a brand-new warm water heater for your home or commercial property, you're most likely thinking about discovering more about your choices.

As you house ages the water taking a trip through your pipes collects more sediment. This is why repiping your home makes good sense.
