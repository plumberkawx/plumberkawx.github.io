<p>Storage centers and surge tanks are typically set up at the terminus of the water conveyance system, generally in between and aqueduct and the circulation water mains. These are centers designed for the short-term staging of water supplies and include water towers, tanks, tanks, secondary reservoirs, and lined ponds. These are best considered flow regulators rather than water storage systems. Since water demand varies throughout the day while the pipe flow rates from the water source remain roughly consistent, usage never exactly matches supply. As so for those durations where water circulation is greater than demand (typically night-time hours), the excess water supply is safely and cleanly saved for later use when demand rate goes beyond supply (normally throughout the work day, though with some variations from morning to afternoon and night).</p>
