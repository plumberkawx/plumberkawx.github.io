<p>Check the washer for wear or cracks when you eliminate the cap to flush out the valve. Replacing a bad washer is inexpensive and simple. However finding the right washer might not be.

<h3>Plumbing And Water Heater Repair Greenville IL</h3>
<p>Warning: If used on a water supply where a pump and pressure tank provides the water (like is used on many rural houses that have a well), the PVB might spit water each time the pump turns off. This is due to the fact that the pressure variations triggered by the pump and pressure tank system can trigger backflow from the irrigation system back into the water system. The likelihood of water spitting, and the amount of water that spits out, both boost with a longer mainline on the watering system. So if you have 10 feet (3m) of mainline in between the PVB and the farthest valve there is less likely to be water spitting than if you have 500 feet (150m) of mainline pipe. One method to stop, or a minimum of minimize, this water spillage is to install a spring-loaded check valve right after the PVB. The PVB may still spill a little water with the check valve set up, nevertheless for the most part it must be much less water.</p>
