Softeners with a timer flush and recharge on the basis of a fixed schedule-- say, 11 p.m. every 3 days, no matter whether the water actually needs it. When required, newer units use electronic sensing units that keep an eye on bead deficiency and other essential metrics based on your water usage and for that reason just restore. These newer systems, also described as demand-initiated regeneration softeners, are ideal since they save energy and money-- using less water and salt for regeneration.</p>
