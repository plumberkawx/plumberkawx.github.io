<p>Run the hot water. Hot water is your pal, especially for your kitchen sink.

Running the warm water after you've used your sink assists clear particles and break up food and oils and keep your drain clear. Funneling happens when the inbound hard water follows a narrow path through the softener's resin bed and does not exchange ions with the resin, leaving your water unsoftened. If you've ever observed that the busier your organisation is, the better your detergent works, the culprit could be an extra-large softener.</p>
<p>Do yourself a favor and buy a flexible water system line. They're a lot simpler to install than stiff metal or plastic tubing. Make sure to get one that's covered with stainless steel mesh. For an excellent seal, hold the hose so it aims directly into the shutoff or fill valve while you're screwing on the adapters. Make them handtight, then add another quarter turn with pliers. Links that are too tight can really trigger leakages or spin the fill valve inside the tank. Check for leaks and tighten them a bit more if needed.</p>
