<h3>Plumbing And Water Heater Repair Williamsburg OH</h3>
<p>Surprise! The majority of brand-new disposals don't come with a cord and plug. You can get rid of the whole assembly and re-install it on the brand-new system if your old unit has a cord and plug.

Domestic water that gets here to your Ohio home brings minerals that can trigger rust on metal parts and elements. To prevent corrosion from rust, storage tanks are equipped with a bar made with magnesium called an anode rod. The rod protects the tank by attracting harmful materials. By having the anode rod inspected routinely and changed as required, you can double the life of your water heater.</p>
