Calcium (Ca2+) and magnesium (Mg2+) ions that trigger water hardness can be removed fairly easily by using an ion exchange treatment. Standard water softeners are cation exchange devices. Cations refer to positively charged ions liquified in the water. Cation exchange includes the replacement of the hardness ions with a nonhardness ion.</p>
