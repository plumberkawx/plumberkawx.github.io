While gas models are less expensive to run, they do require an existing gas line. The price tag of an electrical hot water heater is generally lower, but it can be more expensive to run.

<p>Another downside of water softening through ion exchange is the prospective health risk for individuals on low salt diets. Ion exchange increases the amount of salt in water, in order to lower its mineral content.

Harder water will result in more sodium, as there will be more salt ions exchanged for mineral ions. For most people, this increase in sodium is minor, but if you've been encouraged by a physician to follow a strict low sodium diet this increase can position problems.</p>

<p>A water softener has a resin tank including countless tiny resin beads that hold electrically charged ions. When newly regenerated, the beads become filled with sodium ions from the water softener salt.

The softener system then provides soft water for your use. When water is heated up, tough water triggers white or gray deposits. Water softening can be used to decrease these signs.</p>
