<p>Replace what's exposed. For a house with plaster walls, wood paneling, or other features that make it tough to gain access to in-wall pipes, consider a minimum of replacing pipes that aren't buried in the walls. Although it's a big task, replacing exposed pipes in a crawlspace, utility, or basement  room is fairly uncomplicated, because the plumber can quickly get at the pipes. This is a bad sign. Toilets should absolutely never ever wobble, move, or wiggle. It's not you, and it's not something you're doing.
