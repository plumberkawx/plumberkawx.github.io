It contains an air inlet valve, check seat, and air inlet port.  In standard functional use, water pressure presses the seat up and shuts off the air inlet.  When the water flow stops, it falls back down to open the air inlet port and breaks the vacuum, allowing the device to drain in addition to avoiding back siphonage.
