<h3>Plumbing & HVAC Service Rockford MI</h3>
<p>Often, an inexperienced person will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the presumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair may be as simple as changing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might need the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he generates data on the workings of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's task to understand what the field test information implies for that particular assembly.  When a trained tester analyzes the data, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and needs repair.</p>
<p>A water firmness test would not show a minimized firmness. How do I understand it's working? The FutureSoft is a salt-free system that does not take out the hardness to replace them with sodium.

Also, since the minerals are not being taken out of the water, you will not be lowering the pH, which can trigger water to become acidic helping it to stay alkaline which is very beneficial for you and your house.</p>
