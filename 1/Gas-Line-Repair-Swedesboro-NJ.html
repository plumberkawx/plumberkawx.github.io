In a lot of states, other than Kansas, you are responsible for any gas piping on your home from our gas meter to your home or organisation.

<p>Your initial step is to shut off the water. In many cases, you'll have a shutoff valve right beside the toilet coming either through the floor or out of the wall. If you don't have a shutoff, shut off the water supply at the main shutoff valve, where water enters your house. This is a great time to include a shutoff valve beside the toilet or replace one that leaks. This is likewise a great time to replace the supply line that feeds your toilet (Picture 6). A flexible supply line enhanced with a metal sleeve costs about $7 in the house centers and hardware stores. Pictures 1 - 8 show how to replace the valve.

After mounting the valve (Picture 6), connect the fill tube (Picture 7).</p>
