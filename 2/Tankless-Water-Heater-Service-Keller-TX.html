<p>Small Leaks - A leak doesn't always mean that your water heater's going, it may just be condensation. However it likewise could imply that your tank welds or pipe fittings are used. A plumber is needed if this is the case. When most people think about plumbers, they usually call them for water pipe issues.

<p>Throughout the regeneration cycle, salt water (brackish water developed in the brine tank by mixing water and salt) is travelled through the resin tank (either up or down depending upon the style). As this salt water passes through the tank, sodium ions are moved (exchanged) for the hardness ions on the exchange resin and these solidity ions are consequently sent to drain. This procedure continues till all the solidity ions are exchanged with the salt ions (you'll observe small amounts of salt going to drain along with the hardness ions) and the bed is thought about completely regenerated.</p>
