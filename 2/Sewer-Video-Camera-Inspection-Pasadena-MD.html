Reddish-brown warm water - This observation might mean that you have rust building up in your pipes. But if you're getting this rusty water in just your warm water then it's probably your hot water heater. Water heaters typically have a sacrificial anode rod that draws in the rusting components and it's possible this rod needs to be changed.</p>
<p>Setting up a salt-based softener or water softener alternative provides better, more secure drinking water. When showering in softened or conditioned water you will enjoy healthier skin and hair. To be prepared, determine the distance from the outlet to the top of each disposal before you eliminate the old unit. If the new unit's outlet is lower, you need to also reduce the tee that the discharge pipe links to. Loosen up the 2 nuts that link the tee to the tailpiece above and the trap listed below. Try lowering the tee to see if the tailpiece is long enough. If it's not, you'll have to replace it with one that's somewhat longer.</p>
