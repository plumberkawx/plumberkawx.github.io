These are definitely top priorities for a municipality and its homeowners however difficult water can adversely affect faucets and appliances in a home. With the high calcium material of local water, it can trigger a dishwasher or hot water heater to breakdown. If the problem is repeating or the damage is extensive, you may be much better off repiping. For one-off problems and small leakages, repairing the pipe is typically enough.</p>
