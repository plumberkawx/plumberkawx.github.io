Waste disposal unit guarantees last approximately 5 years, however they can vary in between 2 and ten years. Considering that the typical lifespan of a waste disposal unit is 12 years, you may want to purchase a prolonged service warranty. The majority of warranties cover the cost to repair and replace regular wear and tear failures. To avoid more malfunctions, homeowners must stay up to date with regular maintenance of their garbage disposal.</p>
<p>Cooking oil and other greases should never ever be put down the waste disposal unit because they can restrain the blades. Lastly, cold water must be running when the garbage disposal is on and ought to continue to run for 30 seconds after the disposal is shut off to guarantee that all food particles have been rinsed through the pipes. Baffles: Baffles prevent flatware from entering the garbage disposal, so you're just sending food and compostable waste down the drain.</p>
