When freshly regenerated, the beads become full of salt ions from the water softener salt. As difficult water passes through the water softener system, the calcium and magnesium ions are brought in to the resin beads. There, sodium ions are exchanged for the tough water ions. The softener system then provides soft water for your usage. Difficult water causes white or gray deposits when water is warmed. Water softening can be used to reduce these symptoms.</p>
