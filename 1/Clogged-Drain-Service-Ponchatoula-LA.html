<p>On May 1st of 2007 WSSC Water embraced the International Plumbing and Fuel Gas Codes. Subsequently residential authorizations released after that date need a testable backflow assembly for the fire lawn sprinkler. The assembly was tested at installation and a WSSC Water test tag with the date it was checked was attached. By code this backflow assembly must be checked each year. Also permits released for sub-meters with backflow preventers for yard irrigation systems require an annually test. It is required that this assembly is evaluated in the spring prior to operating the watering system. All testable backflow preventers must be evaluated every year to insure the security of the potable drinking water in your house.
