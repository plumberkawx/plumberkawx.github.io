Given that these systems do not work by exchanging ions, like traditional water softeners do, one benefit declared for the user is the removal of the need to add salt to the system. While particle size decrease and plant growth promotion have actually been claimed, such systems do not eliminate minerals from the water itself. Rather, they can only alter the downstream results that the mineral-bearing water would otherwise have. Testing of specific systems has actually revealed a decrease of calcium scale formation. 11 These systems do not fall within the term "water softening" however rather "water conditioning".</p>

Softeners do not eliminate the TDS and do not cause this type of corrosion A softener is just capturing some cations (primarily calcium and magnesium) and launching other cations at the same time (usually salt or in some cases potassium).</p>
