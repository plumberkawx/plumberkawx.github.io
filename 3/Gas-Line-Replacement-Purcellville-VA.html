<p>To help prevent blockages within the tee (an effect of the baffle inside ), some plumbers will link the disposer discharge directly to the tee of an end-outlet continuous waste, rather than use the method laid out above. Since the baffle efficiently halves the interior diameter of the tee, it's easy for waste from the disposer to clog it up. When the waste must take a trip horizontally (down the arm) and then change direction to fall down the trap, this is specifically real. Having the disposer discharge directly down into the tee permits a direct line to the trap that's reasonably friction-free. In this set-up, a waste arm runs between the other sink drain and the tee.</p>
