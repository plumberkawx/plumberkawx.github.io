<p>Iron fouling is another typical maintenance problem for water softeners. Although colorless, minimized iron will be eliminated by the unit, red-oxidized iron (iron that has actually been exposed to air or chlorine) will clog the resin. Filtration prior to softening insures that oxidized iron is not processed in the softener. Commercial cleaners are readily available if the resin has already been fouled. Once again, it is advisable to inspect the manufacturer's directions for special preventative measures.</p>
<p>Often a clog can be caused due to buildup and grease within the system. If this holds true, snaking the drain will not fix the issue. You might have to check out utilizing a high pressure water system to get rid of the clog. This process is a bit more expensive and will cost anywhere from $400-$ 1000, depending upon the seriousness of the clog. At the time of inspection, make certain to leave all of the gas piping exposed so the inspector can look at the entire system.</p>
