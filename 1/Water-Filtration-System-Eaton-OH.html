The usual use for lubricant in the repair process, is on 'rings (not guides). All 'rings ought to be gently lubed to ensure they do not present of their retainer. The use of too much lube can trigger the backflow prevention assembly to fail or use out quicker by bring in dirt and particles or limiting the motion of the element.
