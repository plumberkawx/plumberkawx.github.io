<p>Remove the old putty with a plastic putty knife so you don't scratch the sink. Seal the brand-new basket in the sink with plumber's putty as shown in Image 4. Plumber's putty can not be used on specific new sinks, but these will be labeled to that effect. Use a non-water-based silicone if you can't use plumber's putty. Excess putty will eject in between the brand-new basket strainer and the sink when you tighten up the locknut in place. Wipe it off with a rag or paper towel. Make certain to insert the cardboard friction ring in between the rubber gasket and the locknut so the locknut spins freely, without catching on the gasket.</p>
<p>Remember, it is very important that you do not put just anything down your garbage disposal system. While such systems are tough machines, they are not blenders. Bones, fibrous and starchy foods, grease, and other inorganic debris can in fact do major damage to your system. Whether you've accidentally harmed your waste disposal unit unit, or it has actually simply suffered from wear and tear for many years, we can look after the required repairs. Our waste disposal unit repair specialists can detect any problem that may emerge with your system, and we can help you pick between repair and replacement. If you want to stay ahead of repairs, regular maintenance is a fantastic way to do so.</p>
<p>During the regeneration cycle, brine (brackish water created in the brine tank by blending water and salt) is passed through the resin tank (either up or down depending on the design). As this salt water goes through the tank, salt ions are moved (exchanged) for the hardness ions on the exchange resin and these solidity ions are as a result sent to drain. This procedure continues till all the firmness ions are exchanged with the salt ions (you'll see small amounts of salt going to drain along with the solidity ions) and the bed is considered totally regrowed.</p>
