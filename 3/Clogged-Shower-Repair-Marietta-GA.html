<p>If you're buying a new toilet, you need to understand the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the large bulk of toilets, the drain is centered about 12 in. from the wall. But with a couple of models, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To check the rough-in, just determine from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. Toilet shopping will be a bit harder if that measurement (plus the density of the baseboard) isn't approximately 12 in.. Most house centers bring only one or two 10-in. designs and no 14-in. models.

If you are replacing a toilet with a standard bowl with an extended" design, the door may not close. Keep reading to learn how to install a toilet.</p>
