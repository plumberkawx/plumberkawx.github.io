<p>Organic particles, such as hair, grease, or food stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is frequently the cause of clogged drains. The most common way a plumber unblocks P-traps is with a tool referred to as a plumber's drain, snake or cable auger. The tool is thoroughly inserted down your drain to clear it of accumulation. You can try to do this yourself, however this isn't a newbie's DIY task. If you utilize the tool improperly, you can harm your pipes and trigger other leakages - so it's worth it to call somebody who understands the drill.</p>
