In the prefilter stage, big particles like silt and rust are gotten rid of by the filter. Next the water goes through the membrane. Hydrogen and oxygen pass through the pores while dissolved solids are captured and eliminated. Lastly, the water goes to the holding tank after going through one last phase of filtration to remove any leftover pollutants.</p>
<p>On May 1st of 2007 WSSC Water adopted the International Plumbing and Fuel Gas Codes. Subsequently residential authorizations provided after that date require a testable backflow assembly for the fire lawn sprinkler. The assembly was evaluated at installation and a WSSC Water test tag with the date it was evaluated was connected. By code this backflow assembly should be checked annually. Likewise permits released for sub-meters with backflow preventers for lawn watering systems require an each year test. It is required that this assembly is tested in the spring prior to running the watering system. All testable backflow preventers must be checked every year to insure the safety of the drinkable drinking water in your home.
