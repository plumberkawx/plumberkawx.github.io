If you live in a cold-weather environment, we extremely recommend repiping your house throughout spring or summer season so you don't need to fret about freezing temperatures throughout the repiping process. Typically, if the problem is restricted to one sink or shower, drain cleaning is most likely the best service. When more than one drain is clogged or sluggish, it can show a larger problem with your plumbing system.

More difficult water will lead to more sodium, as there will be more sodium ions exchanged for mineral ions. For many people, this increase in sodium is small, however if you have actually been recommended by a doctor to follow a rigorous low salt diet this increase can posture problems.</p>
