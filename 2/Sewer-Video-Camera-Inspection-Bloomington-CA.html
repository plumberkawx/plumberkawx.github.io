But with a few models, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To examine the rough-in, just measure from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. If that measurement (plus the thickness of the baseboard) isn't roughly 12 in., toilet shopping will be a bit harder. The majority of home centers bring just one or 2 10-in. models and no 14-in. designs. If you have to special-order a toilet, be prepared to invest a lot more.
