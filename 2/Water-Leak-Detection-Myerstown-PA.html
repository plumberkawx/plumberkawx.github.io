<p>Organic debris, such as food, grease, or hair stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is frequently the reason for clogged drains. The most common way a plumber unblocks P-traps is with a tool referred to as a plumber's snake, cable or drain auger. The tool is carefully placed down your drain to clear it of accumulation. You can attempt to do this yourself, however this isn't a newbie's DIY task. If you use the tool improperly, you can damage your pipes and cause other leakages - so it deserves it to call someone who knows the drill.</p>
