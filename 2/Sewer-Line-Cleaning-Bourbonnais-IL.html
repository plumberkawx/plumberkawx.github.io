<p>Tough water is softened by removing the calcium and magnesium it includes. When tough water travels through the softening system's resin bed, the calcium and magnesium (firmness) ions are removed through an ion exchange process, so only softened water goes through to your home. When the resin bed fills with solidity ions, it should be restored (cleaned). Salt is generally used in the regrowth process and restores the resin to a "clean" state so the ion exchange process can begin once again.</p>
