<p>Camera are among the most valuable tools in the plumbing company. A. Generally wax doesn't "spoil" on a basic floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to avoid leaks. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to avoid odors. If you are experiencing a leak originating from beneath the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or complete blown) toilet blockage down the drain line (or the toilet is broken in the bowl). Likewise, make sure the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "common" unnoticed issue. Try putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>

Then lay a towel in the sink and set the disposal on the flange to keep it from moving.</p>
<p>Lots of toilet problems, including leaking toilets, do not require fixing the entire toilet.

Flapper valves, fill valves, and other tank parts can all break and cause toilet leaks that aren't plainly visible to the naked eye. Toilet leaks around the base can also occur around the toilet gaskets (the bolts that seal the tank to the toilet bowl) or the wax ring below the base of the toilet.</p>
<p>Extremely frequently the circular blade inside is stuck. DO NOT REACH INSIDE TO FREE IT! Just insert a long, durable, wooden deal with (a broom handle will suffice) into the opening.
