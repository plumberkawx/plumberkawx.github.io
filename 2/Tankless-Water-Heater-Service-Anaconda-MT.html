<p>If you're purchasing a brand-new toilet, you need to understand the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the large majority of toilets, the drain is centered about 12 in. from the wall. However with a couple of designs, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To inspect the rough-in, simply measure from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. If that measurement (plus the thickness of the baseboard) isn't around 12 in., toilet shopping will be a bit harder. A lot of house centers bring just one or 2 10-in. designs and no 14-in. models. If you need to special-order a toilet, be prepared to invest a lot more. If there's a door near the toilet, also measure how far the bowl protrudes from the wall.
