We've already seen what these 2 terms have in common, so what's the difference in between them? When it pertains to the problem of tough water, a standard water softener in fact removes silica, calcium and magnesium ions, leaving it with little quantities of what is referred to as momentary firmness". The softener changes these ions with salt through a procedure called ion exchange.</p>
<p>Another drawback of water softening through ion exchange is the prospective health danger for people on low salt diets. Ion exchange increases the amount of sodium in water, in order to lower its mineral material. Normally, this procedure includes 7.5 milligrams of sodium per quart of water, depending on how hard the water was to begin with. More difficult water will lead to more sodium, as there will be more salt ions exchanged for mineral ions. For most people, this increase in sodium is minor, however if you have actually been recommended by a physician to follow a rigorous low salt diet plan this boost can pose problems.</p>
