For instance, if you have a 2 piece toilet, the tank to bowl gasket is your first line of defense versus leaks between the tank and bowl.

Much like with the gasket, often your tank to bowl bolts and washers can end up being corroded or so used that they spring a leak. We strongly advise also changing your gasket and your bolt set to make sure everything is in tip-top shape Whenever you replace your flush valve.</p>
