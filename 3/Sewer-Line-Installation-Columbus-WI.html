<h3>Residential Plumbing Emergencies Columbus WI</h3>
<p>This is an entirely valid question that we hear a lot. The disposal unit is not, naturally, as important as your water heater, water line, or drains. Nonetheless, it adds a fair amount of functionality to the kitchen. A garbage disposal is a fairly little cylindrical device installed under the kitchen drain. When turned on, your disposal unit pulls down wastewater and any product particles by centrifugal force. But it does not shred such debris. Instead, it grinds it into a paste at high speed so that it can easily stream into the drain pipe along with the rest of your wastewater.</p>
<p>The other difference between continuous feed and batch feed is that batch feed disposals just squash the food in batches (for this reason the name)-- not all at once like a continuous feed garbage disposal. One thing to understand about gas lines is they can be extremely dangerous if there is a leak. While gas leakages are uncommon, you need to get out of the structure immediately if you see an odor like rotten eggs in your home. A gas leak can have almost instant results on those exposed to it, and it can even be deadly. If you've got a gas pipe leaking, leave your house and call us immediately.</p>
