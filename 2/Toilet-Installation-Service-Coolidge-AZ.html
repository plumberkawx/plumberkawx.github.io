<p>Backflow is bad news. Clamp the drain hose. The water softener needs to drain the diminished brine option after the regrowth cycle. Clamp the drain hose firmly and feed it into the dedicated drain, like a floor drain or utility sink. To avoid the hose back siphoning drainage, all drain hose pipes should have an air space. The end of the hose be at least 2 inches above the dedicated drain. An air gap might be used to accomplish this, and might be needed depending upon local plumbing codes.</p>
