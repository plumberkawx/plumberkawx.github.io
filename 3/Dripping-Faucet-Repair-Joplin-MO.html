<p>A water softener has a resin tank consisting of countless small resin beads that hold electrically charged ions. The beads become complete of sodium ions from the water softener salt when newly regrowed. As hard water passes through the water softener system, the calcium and magnesium ions are drawn in to the resin beads. There, sodium ions are exchanged for the tough water ions. The softener system then delivers soft water for your use. When water is heated up, hard water causes white or gray deposits. Water softening can be utilized to lower these signs.</p>
