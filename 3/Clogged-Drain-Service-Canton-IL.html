<h3>Bathtub Faucet Repair Tips and Techniques in Canton IL</h3>
<p>For a fire-sprinkler system to operate, the control valve or valves should remain open and the system must be constantly monitored. Therefore, there is a device on each control valve that either prevents the valve from being closed or sends an alarm when it is closed. This device can be as basic as a locked chain through the control valve that prevents that valve from opening, or an alarm that informs the fire department when the valve is closed. Some systems utilize both methods. NFPA 13 describes all such devices as supervisory gadgets.</p>
