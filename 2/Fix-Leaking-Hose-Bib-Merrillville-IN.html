<p>Commercial kitchen garbage disposals can be found in various designs and horse power models to manage a large range of volumes. Light task garbage disposals are usually required in fast food dining establishments, convenience stores, delicatessens and workplace cooking areas. Schools, hospitals, and medium-sized dining establishments can normally use a medium responsibility design. Big dining establishments, hotels, factories and kitchen areas that manage high volumes of waste will need a heavy duty commercial waste disposal unit.</p>
<p>Recent Evaluation: Button Plumbing was great. They changed my kitchen faucet and included 2 new shut off valves under the sink which had constantly leaked in the previous if I shut down the water under the sink. I discussed that my bathroom sink was draining sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were very friendly and got the work done quickly. The rate was rather affordable. I will absolutely use them for any future plumbing needs. I was very pleased with their service.</p>
