I really got their number for another company that couldn't come quickly enough but referred me to Price Buster's. Bo and company were able to come out within 12 hours to examine and give me a quote. They instantly cleared the preliminary obstruction, enabling the occupants to return from a hotel. Unfortunately, upon further examination, there was a considerable blockage that needed excavation to examine. His team was on site the really next day, a Saturday mind you, to start digging a 9 ′ hole.

This occurred yet a third time as they worked their way through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
