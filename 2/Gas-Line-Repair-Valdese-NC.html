They then insert a new replacement pipe on one end and pull it through the old pipe's course using a hydraulic machine. This triggers the old pipe to burst or split in order to replace it with a brand-new, stronger, leak-resistant and highly long lasting sewer pipe without needing to collect the old one initially.</p>
