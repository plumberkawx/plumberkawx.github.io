The result is a backflow where liquid in the pipe sector flows backwards relative to the direction of the system's water supply motion. This opposite circulation is generally localized and can arise from a loss in upstream pressure from, for example, physical failure of the pipe wall or its joints. Such physical damage is more common in smaller pipes based on automobile traffic on overlaying roads, vibrations from nearby heavy equipment operations, settlement of neighboring soil or moving structures, the wear and tear of pipe appurtenances such as meters and valves, and so on. The outcome is a complete damage, dislocation or breaking in the pipe that enables water to get away. Often no apparent physical damage to the pipe is required, just the mechanical failure of an essential pump whose closed down results in a considerable pressure drop across the pipe network.</p>
