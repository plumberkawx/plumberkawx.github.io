<p>There are different products utilized in re-piping, in water supply re-piping a few of the products are metal and maybe some plastic pipes. The metal pipes are galvanized steel or copper, brass, and iron. The plastic pipes are Poly Vinyl Chloride PVC, Chlorine Poly Vinyl Chloride CPVC, Poly Ethylene PE, Polybutylene PB, and Kitec. The majority of these plastic pipe systems will end in lawsuits. Part of the issue is with the fittings that are often cheaply made with little quality assurance by a verity of overseas companies. Plastic pipes likewise have doubtful signing up with techniques. Plastic pipes are glued, crimped, and banded. When plastic pipes blow a joint they blow apart and result in water damage.

<p>A partial reroute is basically a little scale repiping of several affected areas of the plumbing beneath the slab. In cases where jackhammering and fixing the pipe are not cost efficient, it is possible to only abandon the affected area of pipe and reroute the line through the ceilings, attics and walls. Costing less than a complete repipe, completion outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak again in the future. We have experienced homes having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can build up in cost extremely rapidly. This is the main reason why we will advise a full repipe in certain areas, based upon our experience.</p>
