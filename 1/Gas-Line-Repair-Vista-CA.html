<p>Storage facilities and rise tanks are typically set up at the terminus of the water conveyance system, typically in between and aqueduct and the circulation water mains. These are centers designed for the short-term staging of water materials and consist of water towers, tanks, cisterns, secondary tanks, and lined ponds. These are best considered circulation regulators instead of water storage units. Considering that water demand varies throughout the day while the pipe circulation rates from the water source remain roughly consistent, use never ever exactly matches supply. As so for those durations where water circulation is higher than demand (usually night-time hours), the excess water supply is securely and cleanly stored for later use when need rate surpasses supply (usually throughout the work day, though with some variations from early morning to afternoon and evening).</p>
