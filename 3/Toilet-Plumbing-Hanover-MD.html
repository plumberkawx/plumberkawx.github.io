<p>How to replace a garbage or install disposal. Toilet effectiveness- The higher the performance of the toilet, the more it costs. The efficiency of your toilet is measured in gallons per flush (GPF), so the lower the GPF, the more efficient your toilet is. Discover if there are any lead pipes in the house. Houses that were built prior to 1986 typically have lead or galvanized plumbing. Lead, as you understand, no matter how beneficial, is an ecological toxin (note the need for unleaded fuel and paint in houses that is not lead based). You might not want to live in a house that has lead pipes if you have children.</p>
<p>It's also a good idea to have your toilet checked if it was produced prior to 1994, as older toilets are typically much less efficient than more recent designs. You could be wasting numerous gallons of water and numerous dollars on an ineffective toilet. If you want to put new pipes in your house or you're developing a house, there are 3 types of new plumbing pipe available that are building-code approved for homes-- copper, PEX, and CPVC (chlorinated polyvinyl chloride). PEX and CPVC are both plastics and are outstanding alternatives to the pricey copper piping.</p>
