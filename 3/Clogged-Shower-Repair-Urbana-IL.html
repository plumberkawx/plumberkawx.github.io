<p>Siphonage into a pipe system. takes place when there is a reduction in supplied pressure to the water flow. The result is a backflow where liquid in the pipe segment flows in reverse relative to the direction of the system's water system movement. This opposite flow is generally localized and can result from a loss in upstream pressure from, for instance, physical failure of the pipe wall or its joints. Such physical damage is more common in smaller sized pipes based on automobile traffic on overlaying streets, vibrations from surrounding heavy equipment operations, settlement of close-by soil or shifting structures, the wear and tear of pipe appurtenances such as valves and meters, and so on. The result is a complete damage, dislocation or cracking in the pipe that allows water to leave. In some cases no evident physical damage to the pipe is needed, just the mechanical failure of an essential pump whose closed down lead to a considerable pressure drop across the pipe network.</p>
