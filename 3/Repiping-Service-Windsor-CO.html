<p>Another disadvantage of water softening through ion exchange is the potential health risk for individuals on low sodium diets. Ion exchange increases the amount of salt in water, in order to lower its mineral material. Generally, this process adds 7.5 milligrams of salt per quart of water, depending on how tough the water was to start with. Harder water will result in more salt, as there will be more sodium ions exchanged for mineral ions. For the majority of people, this increase in salt is small, however if you've been recommended by a medical professional to follow a stringent low salt diet plan this increase can pose problems.</p>
