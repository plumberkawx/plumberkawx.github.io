This reduction in supply pressure happens whenever the quantity of water being used exceeds the quantity of water being supplied (such as during water-line flushing, fire-fighting, or breaks in water mains). Garbage disposal warranties last an average of 5 years, but they can vary between 2 and ten years. Because the typical life-span of a waste disposal unit is 12 years, you may want to purchase an extended service warranty.

<p>During the regrowth cycle, brine (brackish water created in the brine tank by mixing water and salt) is passed through the resin tank (either up or down depending on the design).

This process continues until all the firmness ions are exchanged with the sodium ions (you'll notice percentages of salt going to drain together with the hardness ions) and the bed is considered fully regenerated.</p>
