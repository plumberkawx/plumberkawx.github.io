<p>Storage centers and surge tanks are normally installed at the terminus of the water conveyance system, typically between and aqueduct and the circulation water mains. These are centers designed for the short-term staging of water materials and consist of water towers, tanks, tanks, secondary tanks, and lined ponds. These are best considered circulation regulators instead of water storage systems. Considering that water need varies throughout the day while the pipe flow rates from the water source remain approximately constant, use never ever precisely matches supply. As so for those durations where water flow is greater than demand (generally night-time hours), the excess water supply is safely and cleanly saved for later usage when need rate goes beyond supply (normally throughout the work day, though with some variations from early morning to afternoon and night).</p>
