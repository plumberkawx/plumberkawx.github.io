<p>A partial reroute is essentially a little scale repiping of one or more afflicted locations of the plumbing beneath the slab. In cases where jackhammering and repairing the pipe are not cost effective, it is possible to just desert the afflicted area of pipe and reroute the line through the ceilings, walls and attics. Costing less than a full repipe, completion outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak again in the future. We have experienced homes having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can build up in cost very quickly. This is the main reason we will advise a full repipe in certain neighborhoods, based on our experience.</p>
