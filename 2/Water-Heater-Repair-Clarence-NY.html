Like any home device, a toilet tank includes numerous small moving parts that might need replaced with usage with time. Flapper valves, fill valves, and other tank parts can all wear out and cause toilet leakages that aren't clearly noticeable to the naked eye. Toilet leaks around the base can also happen around the toilet gaskets (the bolts that seal the tank to the toilet bowl) or the wax ring listed below the base of the toilet.</p>

PEX is simple to install, which suggests the cost of installation may be low also. There is some risk of the PEX pipe splitting, though this is unusual. In basic, it's an economical option that will stand the test of time. We typically suggest this material, though it will depend.</p>
