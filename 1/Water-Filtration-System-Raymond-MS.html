<p>I had a major sewer issue with a 1940s house, with rainwater and sewage was backing up into the basement shower. I began calling any number I could discover on Google. I really got their number for another company that could not come soon enough but referred me to Cost Buster's. Bo and company were able to come out within 12 hours to examine and offer me a quote. They immediately cleared the initial obstruction, permitting the tenants to return from a hotel. Sadly, upon additional examination, there was a significant obstruction that needed excavation to investigate. His team was on website the very next day, a Saturday mind you, to start digging a 9 ′ hole. After fixing this initial concern and setting up a protective liner, it was identified that there was yet another break existed.
