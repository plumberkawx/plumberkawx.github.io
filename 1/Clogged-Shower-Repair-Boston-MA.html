There are 2 main kinds of backflow preventers, and each has its own maintenance requirements. Double check valve assembly (DCV) and decreased pressure zone assembly (RPZ) gadgets are most commonly used in commercial facilities.</p>
<p>A check backflow device (DC) is the easiest and most typical type of device. It has 2 check valves in a completely closed body-- 2 layers of backflow protection. No matter how big the valve is, all DCs are equipped with 1-pound springs that hold the check valves closed during a backflow situation. When you ultimately test a backflow preventer, those 1-pound springs are what you are testing. The device passes if each check valve holds a differential of 1 pound or more on your backflow gauge. That suggests that the check valve is holding shut with at least 1 pound of force. The downside of a DC is that if the very first line of defense stops working and the 2nd line of defense stops working (both check valves stop working to hold), a backflow situation could take place. That is why this type of valve is not defined for what a water company considers high danger" establishments.</p>
