If you smell a gas leak in or around your home, there are safety precautions you must require to secure yourself, your family and your home. Some jurisdictions likewise enable alternatives to backflow preventers. For instance, Philadelphia's water district requires all residential systems providing dedicated sprinkler heads to have a connection from the lawn sprinkler to the toilet tank that's farthest from the water system. This eliminates the need for a backflow preventer, because each time that toilet is flushed, it draws water through the fire line to keep the water fresh.</p>
