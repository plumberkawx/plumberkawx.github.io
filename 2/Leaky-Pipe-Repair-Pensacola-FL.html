Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to prevent smells. If you are experiencing a leak originating from underneath the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or full blown) toilet interruption down the drain line (or the toilet is cracked in the bowl). Also, ensure the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "common" undiscovered problem. If you aren't sure where the leak is coming from, attempt putting a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours.</p>
<p>A water softener draws magnesium and calcium out of the water in order to "soften" it. However to do so, it must put something back into the water. A lot of water softeners use an ion exchange procedure where calcium and magnesium ions are exchanged for sodium ions in the system's resin tank. This tank is filled with resin beads, and the firmness ions (calcium and magnesium) connect themselves to these. The tank flushes itself when certain levels are satisfied, and the system will need to have the salt in the salt water tank renewed.</p>
