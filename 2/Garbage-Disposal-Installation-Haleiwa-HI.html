<p>The next step for an aspiring plumbing contractor is to make a contractor's license. Licensed plumbing contractors can own their own plumbing business and hire or subcontract work to other licensed plumbers.

Some neighborhood colleges and technical schools provide contractor's license preparation and renewal courses. Additional requirements for prospective plumbing business owners might consist of proof of financial reliability, insurance coverage and net worth.</p>
<p>The Mesopotamians presented the world to clay sewer pipes around 4000 BCE, with the earliest examples discovered in the Temple of Bel at Nippur and at Eshnunna, 7 utilised to get rid of wastewater from sites, and capture rainwater, in wells. The city or Uruk includes the earliest known examples of brick built Latrines, built atop adjoining fired clay sewer pipes, c. 3200 BCE. 8 9 Clay pipes were later on utilized in the Hittite city of Hattusa 10 They had changeable and easily removable segments, and allowed for cleaning.</p>
<p>Re-piping is a process of changing the supply pipes in a house or service. It is not a momentary fix or a replacement of brief sections of pipe, but a total replacement of your supply plumbing system. There are a number of reasons you may need to repipe your house or service. Corrosion of pipes may cause low water pressure, rusty colored water, reduced water flow, or leakages. If you are going to redesign it is a great time to repipe prior to you paint or complete your walls.  It is very important to comprehend the scope of the project before work is begun. If you see a separated leak or a little part of your existing piping leaking, or valves that are rusted or broken, it is rather possibly an indicator of a larger issue.</p>
<p>If you're purchasing a brand-new toilet, you need to know the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the huge majority of toilets, the waste pipe is centered about 12 in. from the wall. However with a few models, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To check the rough-in, just measure from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. Toilet shopping will be a bit harder if that measurement (plus the thickness of the baseboard) isn't roughly 12 in.. Many house centers carry only one or two 10-in. models and no 14-in. designs. Be prepared to invest much more if you have to special-order a toilet. Also measure how far the bowl extends from the wall if there's a door near the toilet. If you are replacing a toilet with a basic bowl with an elongated" model, the door may not close. Read on to discover how to install a toilet.</p>
