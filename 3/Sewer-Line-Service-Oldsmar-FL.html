<p>A decrease in supply side pressure triggered by an occurrence such as a water pipe break, or a heavy water demand from activities such as fire fighting, causes the supply pressure to drop below the consumer side pressure. A fouled # 2 Examine Valve allows the excess client side pressure to act upon the Relief Valve Diaphram, opening the Relief Valve discharge. Water will discharge till the supply side pressure once again goes beyond the client side pressure and closes the Relief Valve or until the shut-off valves are closed.</p>
<p>During the regrowth cycle, salt water (brackish water developed in the brine tank by blending water and salt) is travelled through the resin tank (either up or down depending on the design). As this salt water goes through the tank, salt ions are transferred (exchanged) for the hardness ions on the exchange resin and these firmness ions are subsequently sent out to drain. This process continues till all the firmness ions are exchanged with the salt ions (you'll notice percentages of salt going to drain in addition to the firmness ions) and the bed is considered completely regenerated.</p>
