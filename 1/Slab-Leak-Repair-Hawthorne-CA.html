When switched on, your disposal system takes down wastewater and any product particles by centrifugal force. However it does not shred such debris.

<p>Malfunctioning parts: If you have an electrical water heater, a faulty thermostat or a tripped breaker can cause problems. If you have a gas system, the pilot light may head out, resulting in little or no hot water. In general, traditional hot water heater are expected to last 7-10 years with appropriate maintenance. Examine the age of the existing water heater if you're moving into a brand-new house.
