<p>Just like kitchen sink drains, a bathroom drain (whether it's your shower, sink, or bathtub) can be remedied easily if the clog is easy and shallow. For most obstructions you'll simply need a plunger, and sometimes some chemicals, but if this doesn't solve the problem then you may also have to contact a drain professional like Reckon & Reckon to help. As a bathroom drain is also harder to repair and replace than a kitchen sink drain, it's more likely that you'll need a professional plumber's services.</p>
