<p>Unless your bathroom renovation is purely cosmetic in nature, bathroom plumbing might very well be part of your task requirements. Water gets in the top of the water-softener tank and percolates down through the resin beads.

By changing to a tankless design, you'll enjoy unlimited warm water, smaller sized utility bills and more space in your utility closet. There are numerous reasons to go tankless.
