An energy company will identify if there is a gas leak, however they do not locate the source of the leak or repair it.</p>
<p>If you find a leak and go with a patching job instead of a repiping task, simply remember that all the pipes in your home are probably made from the exact same product and they might be next.

If your plumber's auger line is too short to reach to the end of the pipe, go as far as you can from the front of the drain, then begin at the end of the drain and work backwards.</p>
