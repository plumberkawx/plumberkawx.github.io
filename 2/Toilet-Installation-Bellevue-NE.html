<h3>Sink Plumbing in Bellevue Nebraska</h2>

<p>Soft drink dispensers (post-mix carbonators) use carbonated water blended under pressure with syrup and water to offer soft drinks beverages. Many, if not most, pipes are made of copper. When carbonated water enters into contact with copper it chemically liquifies the copper from the pipe.

The Universal Plumbing Code requires that the approved backflow prevention for a post-mix carbonator be a lowered pressure backflow assembly (RPZ). Extra requirements: no piping containing copper will be set up downstream of the RPZ backflow assemblies providing carbonators.</p>
