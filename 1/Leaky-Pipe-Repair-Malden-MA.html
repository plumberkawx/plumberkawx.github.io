For over twenty years, our expert plumbers have been providing exceptional service to all of our clients at affordable rates.

There are two main type of backflow preventers, and each has its own maintenance requirements. Check valve assembly (DCV) and reduced pressure zone assembly (RPZ) devices are most commonly used in commercial facilities.</p>
<p>A double check backflow device (DC) is the most basic and most common kind of device. It has 2 check valves in an entirely closed body-- 2 layers of backflow defense. No matter how big the valve is, all DCs are equipped with 1-pound springs that hold the check valves closed during a backflow situation. When you ultimately test a backflow preventer, those 1-pound springs are what you are testing. If each check valve holds a differential of 1 pound or more on your backflow gauge, the device passes. That suggests that the check valve is holding shut with a minimum of 1 pound of force. The disadvantage of a DC is that if the very first line of defense stops working and the second line of defense stops working (both inspect valves stop working to hold), a backflow circumstance might happen. That is why this type of valve is not defined for what a public utility thinks about high threat" establishments.</p>
