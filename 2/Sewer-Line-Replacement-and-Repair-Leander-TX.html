<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to conventional softening systems. Rather than a big, single tank or twin alternating system that has been sized to deal with peak flow rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller tanks to efficiently get used to your company' circulation rates throughout the day. During durations of high circulation demand, tanks come online to add flow rate capability. During periods of low flow need, tanks go off-line. This new technique to softening is called progressive or responsive flow innovation, and it's perhaps the most crucial innovation in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
