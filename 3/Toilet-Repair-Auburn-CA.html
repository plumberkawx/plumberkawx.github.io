Call 404-524-1825 for skilled Atlanta, GA repiping services. Backflow takes place anytime water streams through a water pipe in the opposite instructions that it's indicated to. Backflow is a problem due to the fact that it can trigger wastewater to recede into a home, contaminating the drinking water. Cover the flapper valve with your hand. Turn on the water (cautiously, so you do not get a cold shower!) and let it flush out the toilet valve for a couple of seconds.</p>
<p>A new hot water heater will likely last longer, offer you less problems, and cost you less to operate gradually. Slow drains: If you observe that your drains are emptying slower, it might be indicative of the early phases of a clog.

If your hot water heater is just a couple of years old and just has a minor issue, repairing it might be best.
