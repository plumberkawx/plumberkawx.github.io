I really received their number for another company that could not come soon enough however referred me to Price Buster's. Bo and company had the ability to come out within 12 hours to investigate and give me an estimate. They right away cleared the preliminary blockage, permitting the tenants to return from a hotel. Unfortunately, upon more examination, there was a significant obstruction that required excavation to investigate. His team was on site the really next day, a Saturday mind you, to start digging a 9 ′ hole. After fixing this initial issue and installing a protective liner, it was figured out that there was yet another break existed. This occurred yet a third time as they worked their method through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
