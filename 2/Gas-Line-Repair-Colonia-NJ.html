Fast heating gas heaters, as a general rule, will warm water far quicker than an electrical water heater of the same fundamental dimensions and capability. An electrical hot water heater might take a complete hour to heat 25 gallons, and a gas heater might warm two times that quantity in the same provided time and perhaps much faster.</p>
