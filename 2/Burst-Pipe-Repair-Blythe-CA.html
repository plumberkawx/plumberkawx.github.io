If you have an older house, there's a good chance you have galvanized pipes. And if your house was built in the 1970s or earlier, those pipes are probably nearing the end of their life expectancy.

Rusty pipes also cause bad water quality and low water pressure.</p>

The easiest is to buy a filtered water pitcher from brands such as Brita. These pitchers use charcoal filters to remove copper and calcium from your water, along with decreasing chlorine taste and odor. Merely fill the pitcher with faucet water and permit it to work through the filter. Then, it's all set to consume and take pleasure in. You can also opt to install a water filter on your sink faucet. This will filter the water and enhance its taste, while also lowering smell. Faucet filtration systems are easy and cheap to install, with numerous models boasting one click" installation.</p>
<p>A new pattern in re-piping is sand blasting the within worn thin pipe and the painting the inside of the used pipe with epoxy paint. Sometimes during the sandblasting the sandblasting will wear thin and blow through the wall of pipes and joints.

Leaking pipes that are epoxy-coated wind up needing to be properly re-piped by setting up a CDA copper re-pipe.</p>
