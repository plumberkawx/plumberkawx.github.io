If you aren't sure where the leak is coming from, attempt putting a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours.</p>
<p>Line up the rubber seal ring on the top of the disposer with the flange below the sink. Press it into place, and loosely secure it by turning the lower mounting ring onto the ramp tabs of the upper installing ring. Turn disposer unit as needed to align drain assembly. There's a nasty odor originating from your drains - You may not notice this immediately, however nasty smells suggest whatever is stuck in your drains-- most likely food waste-- is decaying in there.
