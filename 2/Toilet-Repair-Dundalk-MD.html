<p>A water softener has a resin tank including countless small resin beads that hold electrically charged ions. When newly regenerated, the beads end up being filled with salt ions from the water softener salt. As hard water goes through the water softener system, the calcium and magnesium ions are brought in to the resin beads. There, sodium ions are exchanged for the difficult water ions. The softener system then provides soft water for your use. Tough water causes gray or white deposits when water is heated. Water softening can be used to minimize these signs.</p>
