<p>A partial reroute is basically a small scale repiping of several affected areas of the plumbing underneath the slab. In cases where jackhammering and repairing the pipe are not cost reliable, it is possible to only abandon the affected section of pipe and reroute the line through the walls, ceilings and attics. Costing less than a complete repipe, the end outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak again in the future. We have experienced houses having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can add up in cost extremely quickly. This is the main reason why we will suggest a full repipe in particular areas, based on our experience.</p>
