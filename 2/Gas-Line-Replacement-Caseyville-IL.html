<p>Disposers attach to the sink drain fittings in a number of ways-some use threaded plastic nuts, others big hose clamps-but the mounting-ring assembly revealed here is the most common. To remove the disposer, support it from below and rotate the large, 3-tab mounting ring on top counterclockwise up until the unit falls away. Remove the remainder of the drain assembly by loosening up the three bolts and prying off the retaining ring. Press the drain out through the sink hole and clear away any old caulk or putty.</p>
