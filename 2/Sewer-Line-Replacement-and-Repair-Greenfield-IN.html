For a house with plaster walls, wood paneling, or other features that make it challenging to gain access to in-wall pipes, think about a minimum of changing pipes that aren't buried in the walls. Although it's a big job, changing exposed pipes in a crawlspace, energy, or basement  room is fairly straightforward, due to the fact that the plumber can easily get at the pipes. This is a bad sign. Toilets need to absolutely never ever wobble, shift, or wiggle. It's not you, and it's not something you're doing. That toilet needs to be replaced if you can move a toilet around by doing anything less extreme than swinging a sledgehammer at it. Improperly seated and sealed toilets could leak, damage plumbing, and even jeopardize the structural stability of the house.</p>
