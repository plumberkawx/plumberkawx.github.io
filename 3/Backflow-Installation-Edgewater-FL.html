<p>Sinkholes do not only take place in your yard, regrettably, when a sewer line breaks. The best you can hope for is to find out quickly if there is a leak in a part of the sewer line running below your home's structure.

For instance, if you have a 2 piece toilet, the tank to bowl gasket is your very first line of defense against leaks between the tank and bowl. As it gets used, it can begin to break and harden or just be so crushed that it doesn't fill the area along with it utilized to, and you wind up with water all over the place. Just like with the gasket, often your tank to bowl washers and bolts can end up being so worn or rusty that they spring a leak. Whenever you replace your flush valve, we strongly recommend also changing your gasket and your bolt set to ensure everything remains in good shape.</p>
