As this brine passes through the tank, sodium ions are moved (exchanged) for the solidity ions on the exchange resin and these solidity ions are consequently sent out to drain. This process continues until all the firmness ions are exchanged with the salt ions (you'll notice percentages of salt going to drain together with the firmness ions) and the bed is thought about totally restored.</p>
