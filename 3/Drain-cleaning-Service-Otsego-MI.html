<p>Unless your bathroom restoration is simply cosmetic in nature, bathroom plumbing might extremely well be part of your task requirements. Water enters the top of the water-softener tank and percolates down through the resin beads. The resin has a negative charge, which draws in the positively charged minerals in the water (a process referred to as, ion exchange).
