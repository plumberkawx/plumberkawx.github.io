If your home was constructed before the 1970s, we highly recommend that you work with a plumbing professional to examine your home's plumbing and inspect if there are locations that need repiping. Possibilities are that your home might need comprehensive repiping so that your house's plumbing can function at optimal rates if your house was built decades before that.</p>
