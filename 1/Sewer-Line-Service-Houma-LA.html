It contains an air inlet valve, check seat, and air inlet port.  In fundamental functional use, water pressure presses the seat up and blocks the air inlet.  When the water circulation stops, it falls back down to open the air inlet port and breaks the vacuum, enabling the device to drain along with avoiding back siphonage.  The word siphonage" is extremely important here.  This device only breaks the vacuum to drain water and will not protect against back pressure.  Think of this device as a frost-proof hose bibb with a vacuum breaker.  It likewise has to lie a minimum of 6 inches above any overflow rim or downstream piping.</p>
