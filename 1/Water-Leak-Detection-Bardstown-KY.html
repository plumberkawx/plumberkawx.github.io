Subsequently residential permits provided after that date require a testable backflow assembly for the fire sprinkler system. The assembly was tested at installation and a WSSC Water test tag with the date it was checked was connected. By code this backflow assembly should be checked yearly. Likewise permits released for sub-meters with backflow preventers for yard watering systems need a yearly test. It is needed that this assembly is checked in the spring prior to running the watering system. All testable backflow preventers should be evaluated yearly to guarantee the security of the drinkable drinking water in your home.
