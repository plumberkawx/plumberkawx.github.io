<p>How does ion exchange work? A physical and chemical  process filters the water through an exchange media referred to as resin or zeolite. Typically, the resin is a natural or artificial, sand-like material coated with favorably charged sodium ions. As the calcium and magnesium dissolves into favorably charged ions, an ion exchange environment is created. The water flows through the system while the resin releases its salt ions and easily trades them for the calcium and magnesium ions. The water draining of the device is now considered soft.</p>
<p>More complex is the double check valve assembly (DCVA). This device has found prevalent usage because it avoids both siphonage and back pressure.

Each spring-loaded check valve is set to enable water at anticipated operational pressure to flow through. Must backflow occur, either due to siphonage or back pressure, the springs knock the valves shut tight, preventing the entryway of cross contamination water.</p>
