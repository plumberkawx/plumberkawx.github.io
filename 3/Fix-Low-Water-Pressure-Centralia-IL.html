<p>So, how does a softener understand when to come down to business? The timing of regeneration depends upon the kind of softener you have. Softeners with a timer flush and recharge on the basis of a predetermined schedule-- say, 11 p.m. every 3 days, regardless of whether the water really requires it. More recent systems use electronic sensors that keep an eye on bead exhaustion and other crucial metrics based upon your water use and therefore only regrow when needed. These more recent systems, also referred to as demand-initiated regrowth softeners, are ideal because they conserve energy and money-- using less water and salt for regeneration.</p>
