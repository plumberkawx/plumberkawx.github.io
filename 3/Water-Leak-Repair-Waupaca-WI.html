Make certain to get one that's covered with stainless-steel mesh. For an excellent seal, hold the hose so it aims directly into the shutoff or fill valve while you're screwing on the adapters.

<p>Soft drink dispensers (post-mix carbonators) utilize carbonated water blended under pressure with syrup and water to provide soft drinks beverages. Lots of, if not most, water pipes are made from copper. When carbonated water enters into contact with copper it chemically liquifies the copper from the pipe. This copper-carbonate option (i.e. Carbonic Acid) has been shown to be a risk to the gastrointestinal system. The Universal Plumbing Code needs that the approved backflow prevention for a post-mix carbonator be a reduced pressure backflow assembly (RPZ). Additional requirements: no piping including copper shall be installed downstream of the RPZ backflow assemblies providing carbonators.</p>
