<p>Recent Review: Button Plumbing was terrific. They changed my kitchen faucet and added 2 new shut off valves under the sink which had constantly dripped in the previous if I shut down the water under the sink. I discussed that my bathroom sink was draining pipes sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were really friendly and got the work done quickly. The price was quite sensible. I will absolutely use them for any future plumbing requirements. I was incredibly pleased with their service.</p>
