<p>So, how does a softener understand when to get down to service? The timing of regrowth depends on the type of softener you have. Softeners with a timer flush and charge on the basis of a fixed schedule-- say, 11 p.m. every three days, regardless of whether the water actually needs it. More recent units utilize electronic sensing units that keep track of bead deficiency and other key metrics based on your water usage and therefore only regenerate when required. These newer systems, also described as demand-initiated regrowth softeners, are ideal because they conserve energy and money-- using less water and salt for regeneration.</p>
