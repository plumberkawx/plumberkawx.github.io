<h3>Sewer and Drain Cleaning Tips in Kailua HI</h3>
<p>Look for a jam. Something too tough to grind, such as a piece of glass, might be jamming the motor. Shut off the power and water, then unplug the disposal (If it's hardwired, switch off the breaker.) Remove the rubber baffle inside the drain-most just lift out-and shine a flashlight into the hole. Fish out the blockage with a set of tongs or needle-nose pliers. For example, backflow can occur when there's a break in the main water line or when a fire hydrant is opened for use. Due to the fact that pressure is lost during these occasions, water is no longer being pressed forward into your house and will stream backwards into the city water lines.</p>
