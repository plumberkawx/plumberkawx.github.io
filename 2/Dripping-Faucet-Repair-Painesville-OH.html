<p>A water softener has a resin tank consisting of thousands of tiny resin beads that hold electrically charged ions. The beads become full of sodium ions from the water softener salt when freshly regrowed. As difficult water goes through the water softener system, the calcium and magnesium ions are attracted to the resin beads. There, salt ions are exchanged for the tough water ions. The softener system then provides soft water for your usage. When water is warmed, tough water triggers gray or white deposits. Water softening can be utilized to reduce these symptoms.</p>
<p>The simplest method to remove the firmness is by filtering your water through a water softener. Softening your water down to the optimal level of 6 grains of firmness is perfect for household usage because the water remains less corrosive than over-softened water and is free of scale producing firmness.
