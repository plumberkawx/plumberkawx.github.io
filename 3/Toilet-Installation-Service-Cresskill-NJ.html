<p>You'll need a special garbage disposal if you home utilizes a septic tank and drain field. The system should grind the waste even finer to prevent clogs and enable the tank to be able to drain correctly into the leach fields.

It is likewise permitted to utilize black iron if it is most likely covered with a galvanized finish (which is generally an unique paint").

And if your house is on a septic system, you'll need a disposal specifically designed to be utilized with a septic system. offers a summary 1 of garbage disposals and septic tanks.</p>
