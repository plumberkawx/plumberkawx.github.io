<h3>Signs That Your Water Heater Needs To Be Repaired Or Replaced in Raynham MA</h3>
<p>For a fire-sprinkler system to run, the control valve or valves should stay open and the system needs to be continuously kept track of. For that reason, there is a device on each control valve that either prevents the valve from being closed or sends an alarm when it is closed. This device can be as simple as a locked chain through the control valve that avoids that valve from opening, or an alarm that notifies the fire department when the valve is closed. Some systems make use of both techniques. NFPA 13 refers to all such gadgets as supervisory devices.</p>
