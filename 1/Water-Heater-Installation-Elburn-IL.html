If you smell a gas leak in or around your home, there are safety preventative measures you must take to secure yourself, your household and your house. Some jurisdictions likewise allow options to backflow preventers. For example, Philadelphia's water district requires all residential systems providing dedicated sprinkler heads to have a connection from the sprinkler system to the toilet tank that's farthest from the water system.

It will be better to cope with a new, more efficient unit than to spend on regular repairs.</p>
