<h3>Drain Cleaning Techniques in Somers NY</h3>
<p>Try to find a jam. Something too hard to grind, such as a piece of glass, might be jamming the motor. Switch off the power and water, then disconnect the disposal (If it's hardwired, shut off the breaker.) Eliminate the rubber baffle inside the drain-most simply lift out-and shine a flashlight into the hole. Fish out the obstruction with a set of tongs or needle-nose pliers. For example, backflow can take place when there's a break in the main water line or when a fire hydrant is opened for use. Water is no longer being pressed forward into your home and will flow in reverse into the city water lines due to the fact that pressure is lost during these occasions.</p>
