An approved, effectively set up and kept backflow assembly essentially eliminates the hazard of backflow from either backpressure or backsiphonage. Electric water heaters have a much shorter life expectancy than gas water heaters of similar quality and capability. Still, the distinction is inadequate to make any considerable changes in the cost savings a gas heater will bring. Where a gas heater might last 8-15 years, the electric option will last about 8-12 years.</p>
