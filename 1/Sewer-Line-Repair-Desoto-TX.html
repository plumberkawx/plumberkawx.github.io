It contains an air inlet valve, check seat, and air inlet port.  In standard functional use, water pressure pushes the seat up and shuts off the air inlet.  When the water flow stops, it falls back down to open the air inlet port and breaks the vacuum, allowing the device to drain along with preventing back siphonage.  The word siphonage" is very important here.  This device just breaks the vacuum to drain water and will not secure against back pressure.  Think of this device as a frost-proof hose bibb with a vacuum breaker.  It also needs to lie a minimum of 6 inches above any overflow rim or downstream piping.</p>
