<h3>Ensure Your Kitchen Sink Stays Unclogged With Three Easy Steps in Baytown TX</h3>

<p>After removing standing water from the sink, pour about 1/2 cup of table salt down the drain prior to you gather the boiling water. Let it sit for a few minutes, and then flush with hot water to clear the mixture. Have steel or iron piping and notice rust-colored water originating from your water appliances?
