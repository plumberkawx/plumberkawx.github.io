<p>Storage facilities and rise tanks are typically set up at the terminus of the water conveyance system, typically between and aqueduct and the distribution water pipe. These are facilities developed for the short-term staging of water products and include water towers, tanks, cisterns, secondary reservoirs, and lined ponds. These are best considered circulation regulators instead of water storage units. Considering that water demand varies throughout the day while the pipe flow rates from the water source stay roughly constant, use never exactly matches supply. As so for those periods where water circulation is greater than need (generally night-time hours), the excess water supply is securely and cleanly stored for later use when demand rate exceeds supply (typically throughout the work day, though with some variations from early morning to afternoon and night).</p>
