<p>Current Review: Button Plumbing was fantastic. They replaced my kitchen faucet and included two brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had actually always leaked in the past if I turned off the water under the sink. I discussed that my bathroom sink was draining pipes slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were really friendly and got the work done quickly. The rate was rather sensible. I will definitely use them for any future plumbing needs. I was extremely happy with their service.</p>
