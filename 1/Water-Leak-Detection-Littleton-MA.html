When freshly regenerated, the beads end up being loaded with salt ions from the water softener salt. As tough water goes through the water softener system, the calcium and magnesium ions are brought in to the resin beads. There, sodium ions are exchanged for the hard water ions. The softener system then delivers soft water for your usage. When water is heated, hard water causes gray or white deposits. Water softening can be used to minimize these symptoms.</p>
