Jean Waite paid $856 for a new kitchen garbage disposal. She wasn't over charged, however doing a few things differently could have saved her a lot of money. For instance, a 2-inch service line connected to a 6-inch supply line will have the same pressure. If there is a break or high need for the water downstream from the 6-inch service line, then negative or decreased pressure in the 2-inch supply line will trigger a vacuum and follow or siphonage from the service line.</p>
<p>To link a power cord to the new unit, eliminate the electrical cover plate on the bottom of the disposer and sign up with the colored wires discovered inside with their counterparts in the cord, using wire nuts. The green ground wire is looped under the green screw on the system. This can be done at any point prior to installation. If you irrigate with drinkable water, you are required to have 2 backflow preventers, one at the meter and another one on the irrigation line at the point of connection. If you have 2 meters, safe and clean and irrigation, you are also needed to have 2 backflow preventers, one at each meter.</p>
