When the pressure drops for some factor such as may occur when the fire department links to a fire hydrant to eliminate a water or a fire main breaks or some other situation takes place, infected water might be drawn into the system. To avoid such an occurrence, there requires to be some kind of backflow prevention approach utilized. The best and safest type of backflow prevention is an air gap (a physical separation between the water outlet and the rim of the fixture).

A drain expert like TLC will use a camera to examine your drain system. Often, if you have multiple drain problems you may have a drain line break somewhere in your house or along your drain line to the sewer system. The camera can find and identify the issue so the drain can be repaired.</p>
