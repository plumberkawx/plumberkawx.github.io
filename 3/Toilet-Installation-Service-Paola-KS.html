<p>This 3-stage water treatment system with a stainless-steel filter media tank will filter and soften your water for years to come. Fountains and garden ponds: Automatic refills on these water functions should have either a PVB, an AVB or RP backflow preventers. If backflows take place from them, these water features are thought about a health threat.
