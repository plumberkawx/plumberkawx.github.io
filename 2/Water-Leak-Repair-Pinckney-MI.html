<p>Finally, the most complicated and advanced backflow preventer is the minimized pressure zone device. This device consists of no less than 5 independently operating valves (two check valves and a differential relief valve sealed off at both ends by water tight valves). Each valve functions as a back up system to the other four. Throughout basic water flows at design pressure, the two check valves remain open and the relief valve is closed. The relief valve will spring open if either check valve is clogged and wedged open by particles or if siphonage occurs to the connected service pipeline. To avoid backflow, the downstream check valve will close. Such a advanced and reliable  (if pricey) device is best utilized in critical areas where cross contamination might be a direct risk to life and health.</p>
