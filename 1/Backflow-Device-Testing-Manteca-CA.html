<p>Backflow Preventer: A device that enables water to go through it in one direction, but prevents it from going backwards in the opposite direction. But is a plumbing catastrophe impending or just a concern for the distant future? Changing old pipes in a 1,500 square foot, two-bathroom house costs $4,000 to $10,000, and needs cutting open walls and floors, so you definitely don't wish to do the job before it's essential. Here's how to examine your plumbing system and understand when it's time for replacement. They also need to be set up a minimum of 6 inches above the greatest emission point. They are not meant to have continuous pressure on the downstream side and can not be utilized as a master valve.</p>
<p>When you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes, the usual solution is to have the faulty pipes changed. However, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes changed: whole-house repiping. This is a choice to consider if you reside in an older home (developed pre-1970) or any house with galvanized steel plumbing. Steel was the most popular option for home plumbing for many decades, however steel ultimately suffers from rust and does not have the toughness of today's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>

<p>SofTap's water softening technology is well-suited for household, commercial, and industrial applications, consisting of the prevention of limescale build-up in homes and scaling in commercial water treatment systems, along with enhancing existing reverse osmosis treatment systems. The innovation is easier and more economical than other softening systems on the marketplace today that utilize zeolites, which should be regrowed using brine, or membrane nanofiltration that requires significant water use and high pressure.</p>
<p>Soda dispensers (post-mix carbonators) utilize carbonated water blended under pressure with syrup and water to offer soft drinks beverages. Many, if not most, water pipes are made of copper. When carbonated water enters contact with copper it chemically liquifies the copper from the pipe. This copper-carbonate solution (i.e. Carbonic Acid) has been shown to be a threat to the gastrointestinal system. The Universal Plumbing Code needs that the approved backflow prevention for a post-mix carbonator be a reduced pressure backflow assembly (RPZ). Additional requirements: no piping containing copper shall be set up downstream of the RPZ backflow assemblies providing carbonators.</p>
