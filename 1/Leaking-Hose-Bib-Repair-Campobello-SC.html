<p>A double check backflow device (DC) is the most basic and most typical type of device. It has two check valves in an entirely closed body-- two layers of backflow security. No matter how large the valve is, all DCs are geared up with 1-pound springs that hold the check valves closed during a backflow situation. When you ultimately evaluate a backflow preventer, those 1-pound springs are what you are testing. The device passes if each check valve holds a differential of 1 pound or more on your backflow gauge. That means that the check valve is holding shut with at least 1 pound of force. The drawback of a DC is that if the first line of defense stops working and the 2nd line of defense stops working (both inspect valves stop working to hold), a backflow situation might occur. That is why this kind of valve is not specified for what a public utility thinks about high danger" facilities.</p>
