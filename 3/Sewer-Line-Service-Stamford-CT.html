<h3>Most Common Residential Plumbing Emergencies Stamford CT</h3>
<p>Jamming or Clogged: For the most part, a garbage disposal is only equipped to handle softer organic waste. If bones or other hard foods get stuck in the disposal, it could cause it to jam and not work appropriately. By running warm water through the disposal, you may be able to clear the clog yourself. However you risk of damaging the motor or blades. Use of a video camera in your sewer line can help us better detect sewer backups and sewer line and drain problems. Jim Dandy Sewer & Plumbing provides the latest innovation in video sewer and plumbing drain inspection throughout the Puget Sounds.</p>
<p>A leaking toilet is another typical problem house owners experience. After you flush, if the water continues to run, this more than likely ways your toilet has a leak. This issue is often brought on by a rusty pipe, flush valve assembly or as easy as a worn out flapper valve. A drip pan is effective and affordable. The drip pan is installed under the hot water heater in order to gather any extraneous dripping water. The drip pan can be piped to drain the water outside the home or into an appropriate drain. An ideal time to install a drip or replace pan is when the hot water heater is being replaced.</p>
