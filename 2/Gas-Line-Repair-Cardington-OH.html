More severe cross-connection dangers might need an unique type of backflow preventer that can instantly discharge potentially contaminated water before it gets in the public water supply. Since they should be set up above ground, Minimized Pressure Zone (RPZ) assemblies are furnished in turn-key aluminum enclosures that provide protection versus vandalism and freezing.
