<p>Are rust or minerals building up in your water? The two dead giveaways of rust and mineral accumulation are low water pressure and reddish-brown water coming out of the faucet. As rust or minerals accumulate gradually, they gradually begin to constrict the flow of water, leading to low water pressure. It takes a very long time for this much accumulation to take place, so by the time you notice it, it might be time to repipe. Red or brown water results when little bits of rust break off from the pipes into your water system, impacting your water quality.</p>
