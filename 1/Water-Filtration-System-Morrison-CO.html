<p>Pipeline leak detection is used to identify if and in some cases where a leak has actually taken place in systems which include liquids and gases. A lot of steamfitters, pipefitters, and plumbers learn their trade through a 4- or 5-year apprenticeship. Apprentices usually get 2,000 hours of paid on-the-job training, in addition to some technical instruction, each year. Technical direction consists of security, local plumbing codes and policies, and plan reading. Apprentices also study mathematics, used physics, and chemistry. Apprenticeship programs are sponsored by unions, trade associations, and businesses. The majority of apprentices get in a program straight, but some start out as assistants or finish a pre-apprenticeship training programs in plumbing and other trades.</p>
