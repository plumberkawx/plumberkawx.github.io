Normally, it is possible to do the bulk of the work that needs total water turned off while you are out and about throughout the day, so you experience very little disruption to your day-to-day regimen. To begin the repiping procedure, the plumbing group will first cover any carpet and furnishings to safeguard them from dust and debris. They will then make little cuts in the wall and drywall to locate the pipes and after that get rid of and replace them, leaving as much of the original structure product as possible undamaged.</p>
<p>Customer support is our leading priority. That's why all of our technicians are well-trained and highly experienced.

<p>If you're purchasing a new toilet, you need to understand the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the vast majority of toilets, the drain is centered about 12 in. from the wall. However with a couple of models, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To inspect the rough-in, just measure from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. Toilet shopping will be a bit harder if that measurement (plus the thickness of the baseboard) isn't around 12 in.. Most house centers carry only one or two 10-in. designs and no 14-in. models. If you have to special-order a toilet, be prepared to spend a lot more. Also determine how far the bowl protrudes from the wall if there's a door near the toilet. If you are changing a toilet with a basic bowl with an elongated" model, the door might not close. Read on to learn how to install a toilet.</p>
