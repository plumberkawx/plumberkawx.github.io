<p>How does ion exchange work? A physical and chemical  process filters the water through an exchange media known as resin or zeolite. Usually, the resin is a artificial or natural , sand-like material coated with favorably charged salt ions.

The water streams through the system while the resin releases its salt ions and readily trades them for the calcium and magnesium ions. The water flowing out of the device is now considered soft.</p>

In the prefilter phase, big particles like silt and rust are removed by the filter. Next the water goes through the membrane.
