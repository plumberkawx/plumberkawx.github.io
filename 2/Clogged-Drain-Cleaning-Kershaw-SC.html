<h3>Water Heater Repair Symptoms in Kershaw SC</h3>

Call (866) 701-5306 to schedule a visit. A climatic vacuum breaker (AVB) is not a testable backflow preventer and is not commonly specified by water purveyors.  It contains an air inlet valve, check seat, and air inlet port.  In standard operational use, water pressure presses the seat up and blocks the air inlet.  When the water flow stops, it falls back down to open the air inlet port and breaks the vacuum, allowing the device to drain as well as avoiding back siphonage.  The word siphonage" is very essential here.  This device just breaks the vacuum to drain water and will not safeguard against back pressure.  Think of this device as a frost-proof hose bibb with a vacuum breaker.  It also needs to lie at least 6 inches above any overflow rim or downstream piping.</p>

<p>A double check backflow device (DC) is the simplest and most common kind of device. It has 2 check valves in a totally closed body-- 2 layers of backflow defense. No matter how large the valve is, all DCs are equipped with 1-pound springs that hold the check valves closed throughout a backflow circumstance. Those 1-pound springs are what you are testing when you eventually test a backflow preventer. The device passes if each check valve holds a differential of 1 pound or more on your backflow gauge. That suggests that the check valve is holding shut with at least 1 pound of force. The downside of a DC is that if the very first line of defense stops working and the second line of defense stops working (both examine valves stop working to hold), a backflow situation might take place. That is why this kind of valve is not specified for what a public utility thinks about high danger" facilities.</p>
