An authorized, appropriately installed and kept backflow assembly essentially eliminates the threat of backflow from either backpressure or backsiphonage. Electric water heaters have a shorter life expectancy than gas water heaters of comparable quality and capability.

<p>Your primary step is to shut down the water. For the most part, you'll have a shutoff valve right beside the toilet coming either through the floor or out of the wall. If you do not have a shutoff, shut off the supply of water at the main shutoff valve, where water enters your home. This is a good time to add a shutoff valve beside the toilet or replace one that leaks. This is likewise a good time to replace the supply line that feeds your toilet (Picture 6).
