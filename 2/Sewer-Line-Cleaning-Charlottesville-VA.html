<p>The nationwide average cost to repair a leaking faucet is $65-$ 150, but the cost may be higher, depending on the nature and cause of the leak. Common hot water heater problems consist of cold or tepid water, a leaking tank or scalding water. The reason for these issues can be hard to determine, so it is very important to employ a professional plumbing contractor who is familiar with the understanding needed to find the problem and make the proper repairs.</p>

The heating temperature level is usually pre-set to suit your preferences and requirements. Because they only heat water when required, tankless electric water heaters use less power than conventional water heaters.</p>
