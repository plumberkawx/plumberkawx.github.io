<p>Recent Review: Button Plumbing was great. If I shut off the water under the sink, they replaced my kitchen faucet and included two brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had constantly leaked in the previous. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were very friendly and got the work done rapidly. The price was rather reasonable. I will definitely use them for any future plumbing requirements. I was very pleased with their service.</p>
<p>As difficult water goes through a softener, the calcium and magnesium trade locations with sodium ions (Figure 1). Salt ions are held loosely and are replaced quickly by calcium and magnesium ions. During this process, complimentary" sodium ions are released into the water. Softer clothes without hard minerals caught in the fabric. Fabrics last longer and whites stay whiter without the drab gray caused by hard water. Please send our thanks to all included with testing, repairing, changing and servicing our softener. Appreciate the time and service you send our way. The replacement tank has fixed the problem we were having.</p>
