<p>A check backflow device (DC) is the most basic and most typical type of device. It has two check valves in an entirely closed body-- two layers of backflow protection. No matter how big the valve is, all DCs are equipped with 1-pound springs that hold the check valves closed throughout a backflow scenario. When you eventually evaluate a backflow preventer, those 1-pound springs are what you are testing. The device passes if each check valve holds a differential of 1 pound or more on your backflow gauge. That means that the check valve is holding shut with a minimum of 1 pound of force. The disadvantage of a DC is that if the very first line of defense fails and the second line of defense stops working (both check valves fail to hold), a backflow scenario could take place. That is why this type of valve is not defined for what a water company considers high risk" facilities.</p>
<p>The City of Bellingham needs a backflow preventer on any cross-connection or potential cross-connection. The backflow preventer might be required on the water service line, within the building, or in both areas. The backflow preventer you pick need to be listed on the Washington State Department of Health's Authorized Backflow Prevention Assembly List. Assemblies not currently listed need to have been noted at the time of the initial installation.</p>
