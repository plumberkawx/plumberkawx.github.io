<p>A recently installed water heater must not produce unusual noises, but it will start to produce rumbling sounds as it ages. The sounds get louder gradually as the heater goes to heat up the water. Things aggravate drastically for homes with a high need for hot water. The reasons for the noises can be the accumulation of sediments in the tank which need to be flushed to bring back normalcy. A hot water heater replacement might be needed if the water heater still produces rumbling sounds even after it has actually been flushed.</p>

<h3>Plumbers And House Plumbing Dorchester MA</h3>
<p>Take an example: Say the your heater is 8 years old and you need to work with a plumber for that burner set. The overall repair costs may be in the $300 variety. A gas water heater (not counting miscellaneous plumbing parts) costs $400 to $1200 (electrical water heaters cost about $400 to $800). That repair expense is nearly half the cost of the heater itself, and it's an old heater on its last legs anyhow. Choose the new heater. To ensure that we are offering top quality work and customer peace of mind, all our plumbers are background-checked, licensed, bonded, and thoroughly trained to securely perform water heater replacements. In addition to standard water heaters, we also install tankless water heaters, and heatpump water heaters.</p>
