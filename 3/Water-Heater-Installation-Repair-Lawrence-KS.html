<h3>Plumbing Services Around Lawrence KS</h3>
<p>Warning: If used on a water system where a pump and pressure tank supplies the water (like is utilized on a lot of rural houses that have a well), the PVB might spit water each time the pump turns off. This is due to the fact that the pressure variations triggered by the pump and pressure tank system can trigger backflow from the irrigation system back into the water supply. The possibility of water spitting, and the quantity of water that spits out, both boost with a longer mainline on the watering system. So if you have 10 feet (3m) of mainline between the PVB and the farthest valve there is less most likely to be water spitting than if you have 500 feet (150m) of mainline pipe. One method to stop, or at least lower, this water spillage is to install a spring-loaded check valve right after the PVB. The PVB might still spill a little water with the check valve set up, however in most cases it should be much less water.</p>
