Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he generates data on the functions of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's duty to know what the field test information suggests for that particular assembly.

A versatile supply line enhanced with a metal sleeve costs about $7 in the house centers and hardware shops. Pictures 1 - 8 demonstrate how to replace the valve. Set the height prior to you install the valve (Image 5) if the height of your valve is adjustable. Inspect the directions if your valve is a various style from the one we reveal. After mounting the valve (Image 6), link the fill tube (Picture 7).</p>
