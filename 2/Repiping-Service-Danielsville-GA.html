Make sure to get one that's covered with stainless steel mesh. For a good seal, hold the hose so it aims straight into the shutoff or fill valve while you're screwing on the connectors. Make them handtight, then add another quarter turn with pliers. Connections that are too tight can actually trigger leaks or spin the fill valve inside the tank. If needed, examine for leakages and tighten them a bit more.</p>

If it is over-sized, it will warm more water than you utilize which increases your energy use and energy costs.
