<p>Salt-free systems will also reduce scale accumulation and offer brighter clothes and softer skin using a much healthier method. The main advantage with salt-free systems is the ability to soften water without having to add salt to the water. This is a more heart ecologically friendly and healthy system. Traditional salt-based systems add salt to the water which can have an unfavorable impact on people with high-blood pressure and heart disease. Some cities are starting to prohibit salt-based softeners due to the high sodium material in the waste water. Salt-free systems are maintenance complimentary and utilize no waste water, no salt and no electrical energy or chemicals. In contrast to salt-based systems, salt-free systems are exceptionally low maintenance because the media can last approximately five years without replacing. Salt-based systems require the salt to be replenished on a regular monthly basis.</p>

This process continues till all the firmness ions are exchanged with the sodium ions (you'll see small amounts of salt going to drain along with the firmness ions) and the bed is considered totally regrowed.</p>
