<p>When grinding food stays, use cold water. Prevent utilizing hot water up until the waste disposal unit is turned off. In most cases, a lack of warm water is triggered by a malfunctioning circuit breaker or a broken high-temperature cutoff switch. If the water is lukewarm, the dip tube inside the tank may be split. Scalding water is usually the outcome of a damaged pressure relief valve or a bad thermostat.
