<p>Reverse osmosis is the process utilized to purify water utilized for drinking and cooking. The water in our RO system goes through three stages. In the prefilter stage, large particles like silt and rust are eliminated by the filter. Next the water goes through the membrane. Hydrogen and oxygen pass through the pores while liquified solids are caught and gotten rid of. Finally, the water goes to the holding tank after going through one last phase of filtration to get rid of any leftover pollutants.</p>
<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to conventional softening systems. Instead of a big, single tank or twin rotating system that has been sized to manage peak circulation rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller sized tanks to efficiently get used to your organisation' flow rates throughout the day. Throughout periods of high circulation need, tanks come online to add flow rate capability. During durations of low flow need, tanks go off-line. This new approach to softening is called progressive or responsive flow innovation, and it's perhaps the most essential development in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
