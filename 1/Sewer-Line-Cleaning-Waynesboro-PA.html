<h3>Things To Know Before Hiring A Sewer Cleaning Company at Waynesboro PA</h3>
<p>I had a major sewer concern with a 1940s home, with rainwater and sewage was backing up into the basement shower. I started calling any number I could discover on Google. I in fact got their number for another company that couldn't come quickly enough but referred me to Cost Buster's. Bo and company were able to come out within 12 hours to investigate and offer me a price quote. They instantly cleared the initial clog, allowing for the occupants to return from a hotel. Regrettably, upon more examination, there was a substantial clog that needed excavation to investigate. His team was on website the very next day, a Saturday mind you, to start digging a 9 ′ hole. After fixing this initial concern and setting up a protective liner, it was figured out that there was yet another break existed. This occurred yet a 3rd time as they worked their method through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
