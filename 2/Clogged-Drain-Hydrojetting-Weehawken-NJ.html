<h3>Easy Basic Kitchen Faucet Repair in Weehawken NJ</h3>

<p>A check backflow device (DC) is the simplest and most common type of device. It has two check valves in an entirely closed body-- 2 layers of backflow protection. No matter how big the valve is, all DCs are equipped with 1-pound springs that hold the check valves closed throughout a backflow scenario. When you ultimately check a backflow preventer, those 1-pound springs are what you are testing. If each check valve holds a differential of 1 pound or more on your backflow gauge, the device passes. That means that the check valve is holding shut with a minimum of 1 pound of force. The downside of a DC is that if the very first line of defense fails and the 2nd line of defense stops working (both check valves stop working to hold), a backflow scenario might occur. That is why this type of valve is not specified for what a water company considers high danger" facilities.</p>
