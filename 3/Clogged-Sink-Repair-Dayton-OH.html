<p>Recent Review: Button Plumbing was excellent. They changed my kitchen faucet and included two brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had actually always leaked in the past if I shut off the water under the sink. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were extremely friendly and got the work done rapidly. The price was quite reasonable. I will certainly utilize them for any future plumbing requirements. I was extremely delighted with their service.</p>
