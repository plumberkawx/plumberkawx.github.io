<p>Lubrication might aid with the positioning of some parts within the body of the backflow prevention assembly. Lubricant does not help the assembly work any much better, it is just there to help the specialist put together the components into the body without developing damage from friction. The lube should be a food grade lube to guarantee the water system is not contaminated. In most cases the best lube is water. The typical usage for lube in the repair procedure, is on 'rings (not guides). All 'rings need to be lightly oiled to assure they do not roll out of their retainer. Making use of too much lube can cause the backflow prevention assembly to fail or wear out faster by attracting dirt and particles or restricting the movement of the part. The appropriate quantity of lube need to make the surface area of the 'ring appear wet. You must never ever see chunks or globs of lube.</p>

Well, first let's ask you a different question: How old is your home? If it was constructed prior to 1970, it might have pipes made from an out-of-date material that will start to give you problems in the not-too-distant future (if they haven't already). And if your home was constructed before World War II, then it probably needs replacements for its old pipes, most likely whole-house repiping.</p>
<p>The use of dissimilar metals in the plumbing can result in galvanic rust Direct contact between dissimilar metals will start the formation of a galvanic cell, which is created whenever 2 different kinds of metal are conductively connected to each other, and then immersed in an electrolyte such as water. Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be corroded and an electrical current is created since of the process. A typical example of this is when galvanized pipe is straight connected to copper pipe. It is also worth noting that while utilizing a brass fitting to bridge the space in between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it also will not entirely prevent it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be utilized to reduce this direct contact between the different metals. A dielectric coupling includes an insulating material that physically separates contact between the 2 metals.</p>
