<h3>Emergency Plumbing Service And Maintenance Camarillo CA</h3>
<p>Warning: If utilized on a water system where a pump and pressure tank provides the water (like is used on a lot of rural homes that have a well), the PVB might spit water each time the pump turns off. This is since the pressure variations caused by the pump and pressure tank system can cause backflow from the irrigation system back into the water supply. The likelihood of water spitting, and the quantity of water that spits out, both boost with a longer mainline on the watering system. So if you have 10 feet (3m) of mainline between the PVB and the farthest valve there is less likely to be water spitting than if you have 500 feet (150m) of mainline pipe. One way to stop, or a minimum of decrease, this water spillage is to install a spring-loaded check valve right after the PVB. The PVB might still spill a little water with the check valve set up, however in most cases it should be much less water.</p>
