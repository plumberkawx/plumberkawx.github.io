<p>Siphonage into a pipe system. When there is a decline in supplied pressure to the water flow, happens. The outcome is a backflow where liquid in the pipe segment streams in reverse relative to the instructions of the system's supply of water motion. This opposite flow is typically localized and can result from a loss in upstream pressure from, for instance, physical failure of the pipe wall or its joints. Such physical damage is more common in smaller sized pipes based on vehicle traffic on overlaying roads, vibrations from adjacent heavy devices operations, settlement of close-by soil or moving foundations, the wear and tear of pipe appurtenances such as meters and valves, etc. The result is a complete breakage, dislocation or breaking in the pipe that allows water to leave.

<p>A partial reroute is basically a small scale repiping of several affected locations of the plumbing underneath the slab. In cases where jackhammering and repairing the pipe are not cost efficient, it is possible to just abandon the affected area of pipe and reroute the line through the walls, ceilings and attics. Costing less than a full repipe, completion outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak again in the future. We have experienced houses having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can add up in cost extremely rapidly. This is the main reason that we will suggest a full repipe in certain communities, based upon our experience.</p>
