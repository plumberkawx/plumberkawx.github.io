<p>Backflow prevention gadgets are developed to protect the general public water supply from cross-connections. A modern neighborhood water supply system is created to make sure that water streams to residential or commercial properties and buildings under pressure. If there is a cross-connection in between the water supply and a polluted source, this community water network consists of many users where there is a danger to public health. A cross-connection can occur where there is a pressure drop in the water pipe. This pressure drop triggers a vacuum and siphons of entrainment water from end-users into the public water supply.</p>
<p>How does ion exchange work? A chemical and physical procedure filters the water through an exchange media called resin or zeolite. Usually, the resin is a artificial or natural , sand-like material coated with favorably charged sodium ions.

The water streams through the system while the resin launches its salt ions and easily trades them for the calcium and magnesium ions. The water flowing out of the device is now considered soft.</p>

<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to conventional softening systems. Instead of a large, single tank or twin alternating system that has actually been sized to deal with peak flow rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller sized tanks to efficiently adjust to your service' circulation rates throughout the day. Throughout durations of high circulation demand, tanks come online to include circulation rate capacity. Throughout periods of low flow demand, tanks go off-line.
