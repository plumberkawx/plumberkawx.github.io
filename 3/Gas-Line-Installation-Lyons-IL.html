We believe that if you are going to buy copper piping, do it once, do it right.</p>
<p>In community water system systems, water is generally maintained at a considerable pressure to make it possible for water to stream to and out of the plumbing fixtures in your house or company. When the pressure drops for some reason such as might happen when the fire department links to a fire hydrant to fight a water or a fire main breaks or some other circumstance takes place, contaminated water may be drawn into the system. To avoid such an occurrence, there needs to be some kind of backflow prevention technique utilized. The best and safest kind of backflow prevention is an air space (a physical separation between the water outlet and the rim of the component). The proper backflow prevention device is required if an air space is not possible. This backflow device is considered a containment" backflow preventer and is regulated by the Ohio Epa and your water supplier.</p>
