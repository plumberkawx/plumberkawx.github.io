<p>A normal water softener consists of a tall, narrow water-softener tank, and a short, broad salt water tank. The softener tank is connected to the house's water-supply line.

From brand-new bathroom components to custom-made countertops, we truly have all of it. Our inventory makes us the best plumbing company for any job in Seattle, WA.

<p>The most efficient way to attend to hard water is with a water softener. When calcium and magnesium-- the firmness ions-- are gathered by tiny resin beads through a process called ion exchange, water is softened. The resin beads are charged with salt or potassium ions. When tough water comes in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are taken out of the water and changed with salt or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
