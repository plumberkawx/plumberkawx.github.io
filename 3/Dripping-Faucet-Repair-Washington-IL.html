<p>In some cases a clog can be caused due to accumulation and grease within the system. Snaking the drain won't fix the problem if this is the case. You may need to look into utilizing a high pressure water supply to get rid of the clog. This process is a bit more costly and will cost anywhere from $400-$ 1000, depending on the severity of the clog. At the time of inspection, make certain to leave all of the gas piping exposed so the inspector can look at the entire system.</p>
