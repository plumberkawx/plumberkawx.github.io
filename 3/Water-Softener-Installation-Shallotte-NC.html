The regrowth procedure can be set up instantly with an electric timer, through a mechanical water meter, or a computer system.</p>
<p>Those people in the market understand that cross-connection programs in many areas have actually vastly lowered the variety of reported events that take place within our water supply. This has at times resulted in individuals believing that backflow concerns and problems no longer exist or that there might never really have been a concern in the first place. This thinking can be both hazardous and detrimental. Backflow occurrences in water systems are a result of changes in pressure within that system.  Every system may not need a lowered pressure principle backflow assembly.  In far too many areas we have an all or nothing technique to backflow protection. We need to take a look at each installation for the threat it presents and after that install the correct protection.</p>
