<p>Scrape off the old putty with a plastic putty knife so you do not scratch the sink. Seal the brand-new basket in the sink with plumber's putty as shown in Picture 4. Plumber's putty can not be utilized on certain brand-new sinks, but these will be labeled to that effect. If you can't use plumber's putty, use a non-water-based silicone. When you tighten up the locknut in place, excess putty will squeeze out in between the new basket strainer and the sink. Wipe it off with a rag or paper towel. Make sure to insert the cardboard friction ring in between the rubber gasket and the locknut so the locknut spins easily, without capturing on the gasket.</p>

Clogged clog and drainage problems may begin as small issues but can quickly speed up into considerable concerns. A clogged drain can even lead to slow water drainage, flooding, sewage backup, and costly repairs.</p>
