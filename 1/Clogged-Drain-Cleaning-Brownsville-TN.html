In cases where repairing the pipe and jackhammering are not cost reliable, it is possible to only desert the affected area of pipe and reroute the line through the walls, ceilings and attics. Costing less than a full repipe, the end result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak again in the future. We have actually experienced houses having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can add up in cost very rapidly.
