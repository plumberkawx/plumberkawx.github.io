<p>Will sears install my waste disposal unit for me. The easiest backflow prevention device is the barometric loop. This is just a non-mechanical pipe length forming a loop extending a minimum of 35 feet vertically above the supply of water pipeline. The height is required to conquer the ambient air pressure (at mean sea level) of 34 feet of head (14.6959 psi). A loop of pipe this high avoids a siphon from forming. Its benefits are the simplicity of its style and lack of moving parts. However, it may be not practical in many scenarios to install a pipe segment of this length. Additionally, a barometric loop will not prevent back pressure from forming as the result of a pump failure.</p>
