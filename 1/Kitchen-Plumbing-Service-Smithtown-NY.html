It is necessary to turn the inlet shut-off valve on gradually while the drawback shut off stays in the closed position. This allows the parts to transfer to their pressurized positions in an accurate movement. As soon as the assembly is pressurized, then any built up air needs to be eliminated from the body. Most backflow prevention assemblies have air bleeds or air screws so that air can be gotten rid of from important areas in the assembly. In some models, test dicks can be utilized to get rid of air from an assembly if they are near the top of the body or in a location where the air will collect.</p>
