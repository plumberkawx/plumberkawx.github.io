<p>To help avoid clogs within the tee (a repercussion of the baffle inside ), some plumbers will link the disposer discharge directly to the tee of an end-outlet continuous waste, rather than utilize the approach set out above. It's easy for waste from the disposer to clog it up due to the fact that the baffle successfully halves the interior size of the tee. This is particularly true when the waste should travel horizontally (down the arm) and after that change direction to fall down the trap. Having the disposer discharge directly down into the tee enables a direct line to the trap that's reasonably friction-free. In this set-up, a waste arm runs in between the other sink drain and the tee.</p>
