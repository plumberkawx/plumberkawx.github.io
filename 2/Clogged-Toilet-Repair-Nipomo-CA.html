<p>Storage centers and rise tanks are usually installed at the terminus of the water conveyance system, generally in between and aqueduct and the circulation water mains. These are centers designed for the short-term staging of water supplies and consist of water towers, tanks, cisterns, secondary reservoirs, and lined ponds. These are best considered circulation regulators rather than water storage units. Considering that water demand differs throughout the day while the pipe circulation rates from the water source remain approximately continuous, use never ever precisely matches supply. As so for those durations where water circulation is higher than need (typically night-time hours), the excess supply of water is safely and easily saved for later use when need rate goes beyond supply (typically throughout the work day, though with some variations from early morning to afternoon and evening).</p>
