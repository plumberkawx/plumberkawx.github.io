<p>Siphonage into a pipe system. When there is a reduction in supplied pressure to the water circulation, occurs. The outcome is a backflow where liquid in the pipe segment streams backwards relative to the instructions of the system's water system movement. This opposite flow is normally localized and can result from a loss in upstream pressure from, for instance, physical failure of the pipe wall or its joints. Such physical damage is more typical in smaller pipes subject to car traffic on overlaying roads, vibrations from surrounding heavy equipment operations, settlement of nearby soil or moving structures, the wear and tear of pipe appurtenances such as meters and valves, and so on. The outcome is a total breakage, dislocation or splitting in the pipe that allows water to escape.

Instead of a big, single tank or twin alternating system that has been sized to handle peak circulation rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller tanks to efficiently adapt to your service' circulation rates throughout the day. Throughout periods of high circulation need, tanks come on-line to include flow rate capability. During periods of low flow need, tanks go off-line. This brand-new technique to softening is called progressive or responsive circulation technology, and it's probably the most crucial development in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
