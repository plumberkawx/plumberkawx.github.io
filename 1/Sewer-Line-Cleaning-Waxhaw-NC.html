<p>Backflow prevention testers generally have participated in a course on the subject and they also may pick to be certified by finishing an assessment process. As soon as a person becomes a certified tester, there is a great chance the person knows how to evaluate a backflow preventer.

You can repeat this process if it does not work the very first time.
