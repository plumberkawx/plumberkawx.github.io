<p>Installation and replacement expenses are frequently equivalent, though replacement normally will not require added fees, such as application charges. New meters should meet policies and code requirements for their positioning, and gas providers might need a special meter for their services, restricting your choices. Do-it-yourselfers and contractors are responsible for scheduling inspections by calling the office number noted on the structure permit. Inspections must be made after structure excavation (prior to pouring concrete), after rough-in (prior to concealing work), and upon completion. NOTE: If malfunctioning work is found, the inspector will release an infraction notice, and a particular time period is allocated to fix the issue.</p>
