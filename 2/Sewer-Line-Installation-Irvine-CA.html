Install a hair stopper in your shower drain - The top reason our Tewksbury drain cleaning professionals are called into a home is for hair in the shower drain. Installing a hair stopper is simple and low-cost and will conserve you from the constant need of drain cleaning.</p>
<p>A few local authorities require that the PVB be set up within 18 inches (450mm) of the connection to the water source, in which case you can't use a PVB unless the water source is at the high-end of the irrigated area. It may not be installed in any place where it may ever be immersed under water. Some towns do not enable the use of PVBs with drip irrigation systems. Some don't permit the usage of a PVB at all, so contact your water supplier. A PVB backflow preventer may spill or spit water out from under the cap when backflow takes place, so it ought to be installed in a location where water spillage would not cause problems.</p>
