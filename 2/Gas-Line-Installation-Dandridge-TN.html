<p>Salt-free systems will also minimize scale buildup and supply brighter clothing and softer skin using a healthier method. The main advantage with salt-free systems is the ability to soften water without needing to include sodium to the water. This is a more heart healthy and eco-friendly system. Conventional salt-based systems add salt to the water which can have a negative impact on individuals with high-blood pressure and heart disease. Some cities are beginning to ban salt-based softeners due to the high sodium material in the waste water. Salt-free systems are maintenance totally free and utilize no drainage, no salt and no electrical power or chemicals. In contrast to salt-based systems, salt-free systems are incredibly low maintenance due to the fact that the media can last as much as 5 years without changing. Salt-based systems require the salt to be renewed on a month-to-month basis.</p>
