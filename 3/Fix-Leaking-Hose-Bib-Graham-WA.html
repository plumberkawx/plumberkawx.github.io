It cost less than copper and was easier to install. Regrettably, any house that plumbed with polybutylene resembles a ticking time bomb. It is not a concern of if it will leak, but when. A clogged or backed up drain pipe is an issue. Sometimes a homeowner can unclog a drain with a commercial item or with a plunger. Sometimes unclogging a drain takes taking apart the plug and putting a hook to pull out hair and gunk. And often even then absolutely nothing gets that drain cleared, not even basing on one's head and muttering necromancies to the drain gods.</p>
