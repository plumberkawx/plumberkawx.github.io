<p>Difficult water is softened by removing the calcium and magnesium it includes. When difficult water travels through the softening system's resin bed, the calcium and magnesium (solidity) ions are eliminated through an ion exchange procedure, so just softened water goes through to your house. When the resin bed fills with solidity ions, it should be regrowed (cleaned). Salt is typically used in the regeneration procedure and restores the resin to a "clean" state so the ion exchange process can start again.</p>

<p>If you notice your water costs rising, it could be a leak you can't see. Call us for our leak detection service today. If you see absolutely nothing obvious, insert the wrench into the motor spline, found at the bottom of the unit, and twist ideal and left. If the motor spins freely, check that the circuit breaker hasn't tripped and after that try the reset button. If these steps do not work, and your disposer's warranty has ended, it's time to replace it.</p>
<p>Do you need a replacement for an older system that's become bothersome, or simply for a new look? How about for a building addition or major remodel? When again, that's something you could do yourself, although it's usually much better to work with an experienced sink plumber in the San Diego area. Installation involves over a dozen steps, and getting rid of the old one involves even more operations. It can be tough matching up cut outs and fixture holes, and getting the new installation flat and level with everything sealed up.</p>
