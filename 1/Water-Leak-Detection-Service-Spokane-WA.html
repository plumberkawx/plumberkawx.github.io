An efficient softener can decrease annual cleaning agent costs by more than $6,000. Many company owner presume that due to the fact that they have actually a softener set up, they are already understanding these savings. But, that is not always the case.

<p>The Plumbing Division of the Buildings, Security Engineering and Environmental Department is responsible for making sure that plumbing systems and experienced trade persons are in compliance with code and ordinance requirements.

<p>Loosen up the screws on the upper install ring (flange install) enough to press the phone a bit - you'll see a little "snap ring" around the bottom of the sink flange (this ring keeps the install ring from sliding off the flange).

The flange (and associated gasket, if suitable) can now be popped out of the drain hole. Clean the area for the new unit.</p>
