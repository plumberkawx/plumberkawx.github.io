<p>Another disadvantage of water softening through ion exchange is the potential health risk for individuals on low salt diets. Ion exchange increases the amount of sodium in water, in order to decrease its mineral material. Usually, this process includes 7.5 milligrams of salt per quart of water, depending upon how tough the water was to start with. Harder water will lead to more salt, as there will be more sodium ions exchanged for mineral ions. For many people, this boost in salt is small, however if you've been recommended by a physician to follow a stringent low salt diet plan this boost can present problems.</p>
