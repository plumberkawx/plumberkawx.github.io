<p>On May 1st of 2007 WSSC Water adopted the International Plumbing and Fuel Gas Codes. Subsequently residential authorizations provided after that date need a testable backflow assembly for the fire sprinkler system. The assembly was tested at installation and a WSSC Water test tag with the date it was tested was connected. By code this backflow assembly should be checked annually. Also permits issued for sub-meters with backflow preventers for yard watering systems require an each year test. It is needed that this assembly is evaluated in the spring before operating the watering system. All testable backflow preventers need to be tested annually to guarantee the security of the safe and clean drinking water in your house.
