Subsequently residential permits provided after that date need a testable backflow assembly for the fire sprinkler system. The assembly was checked at installation and a WSSC Water test tag with the date it was evaluated was connected. By code this backflow assembly should be evaluated every year. Likewise permits released for sub-meters with backflow preventers for lawn irrigation systems require an each year test. It is required that this assembly is evaluated in the spring prior to running the watering system.
