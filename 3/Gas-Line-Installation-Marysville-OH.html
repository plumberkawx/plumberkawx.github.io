Customer Investigator Jodi Brooks called around to attempt to get a quote from private plumbers for a garbage disposal replacement. None of the businesses we called would give a quote over the phone. All of them wanted to take a look at the situation before dedicating to a price, and all wished to charge a service charge to come out. Brooks discovered just one plumber who would come out without charging.</p>
