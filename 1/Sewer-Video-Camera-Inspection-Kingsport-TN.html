These are centers created for the short-term staging of water supplies and consist of water towers, tanks, cisterns, secondary reservoirs, and lined ponds. These are best considered flow regulators rather than water storage units. Considering that water need varies throughout the day while the pipe flow rates from the water source remain approximately constant, use never precisely matches supply. As so for those durations where water flow is greater than need (typically night-time hours), the excess supply of water is securely and cleanly stored for later usage when demand rate goes beyond supply (usually throughout the work day, though with some variations from early morning to afternoon and night).</p>
