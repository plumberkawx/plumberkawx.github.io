<p>A double check backflow device (DC) is the most basic and most typical type of device. It has 2 check valves in a totally closed body-- 2 layers of backflow security. No matter how large the valve is, all DCs are equipped with 1-pound springs that hold the check valves closed during a backflow situation. Those 1-pound springs are what you are testing when you eventually test a backflow preventer. The device passes if each check valve holds a differential of 1 pound or more on your backflow gauge.
