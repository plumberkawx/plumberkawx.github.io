<p>On May 1st of 2007 WSSC Water embraced the International Plumbing and Fuel Gas Codes. Consequently residential authorizations released after that date need a testable backflow assembly for the fire lawn sprinkler. The assembly was evaluated at installation and a WSSC Water test tag with the date it was evaluated was attached. By code this backflow assembly must be tested every year. Likewise permits issued for sub-meters with backflow preventers for lawn watering systems need an annually test. It is needed that this assembly is evaluated in the spring prior to running the watering system. All testable backflow preventers must be tested each year to guarantee the safety of the safe and clean drinking water in your house.
