<p>Leakages are sly. While the time required will differ based on your home size and the number of discovered malfunctions, it's best to reserve approximately two hours when you arrange an inspection. There's always the opportunity that your plumber's previous job will run long and delay the beginning time.

Ask how long the inspection usually takes when you call to arrange your visit.</p>
<p>A water softener draws magnesium and calcium out of the water in order to "soften" it. However to do so, it must put something back into the water. Many water softeners use an ion exchange process where calcium and magnesium ions are exchanged for salt ions in the system's resin tank. This tank is filled with resin beads, and the firmness ions (calcium and magnesium) attach themselves to these. The tank flushes itself when specific levels are met, and the system will need to have the salt in the brine tank replenished.</p>
