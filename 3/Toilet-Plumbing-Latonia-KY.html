<h3>The Importance Of Drain Cleaning and How it Affects Your Home in Latonia KY</h3>
<p>I had a major sewer concern with a 1940s house, with rainwater and sewage was backing up into the basement shower. I began calling any number I could find on Google. I really got their number for another company that couldn't come soon enough however referred me to Price Buster's. Bo and company had the ability to come out within 12 hours to examine and provide me a price quote. They immediately cleared the initial obstruction, allowing for the tenants to return from a hotel. Regrettably, upon more examination, there was a considerable obstruction that needed excavation to examine. His group was on website the very next day, a Saturday mind you, to begin digging a 9 ′ hole. After repairing this initial concern and installing a protective liner, it was determined that there was yet another break existed. This happened yet a third time as they worked their way through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
<p>In addition to the specific centers noted above, an authorized backflow prevention assembly must be installed on each safe and clean water service connection to any premises containing a prospective or actual danger. Noted below are examples of dangers and the minimum protection required to be set up for each kind of hazard.

<p>If you're buying a brand-new toilet, you need to know the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the large bulk of toilets, the drain is focused about 12 in. from the wall. But with a few models, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To check the rough-in, simply determine from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. Toilet shopping will be a bit harder if that measurement (plus the thickness of the baseboard) isn't approximately 12 in.. Many house centers bring just one or two 10-in. designs and no 14-in. designs. Be prepared to invest much more if you have to special-order a toilet.
