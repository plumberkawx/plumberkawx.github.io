<p>While the "Big 4" - fill valve, flush valve, flapper, and trip lever - tend to be the main focus of a lot of repairs, there are lots of other small toilet parts that need to also be well maintained to assist avoid leakages and other toilet problems. For instance, if you have a 2 piece toilet, the tank to bowl gasket is your first line of defense versus leaks between the tank and bowl. As it gets used, it can start to solidify and crack or merely be so squished that it doesn't fill the space as well as it used to, and you wind up with water all over the location. Much like with the gasket, often your tank to bowl bolts and washers can end up being corroded or so used that they spring a leak. We strongly advise also changing your gasket and your bolt set to make sure everything is in tip-top shape Whenever you replace your flush valve.</p>
