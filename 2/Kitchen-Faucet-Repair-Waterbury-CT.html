Jay B and Aaron scoped the task rapidly and described the game plan for diagnosis and repair. They kept me educated and stood firm through extremely challenging sewer line clean-up and repair. I will recommend SW plumbing for any major repair work.</p>
<p>So what should you do as a homeowner? To start with, do not attempt to deal with the task of repairing the sink yourself.

<p>While the "Huge 4" - fill valve, flush valve, flapper, and trip lever - tend to be the main focus of a lot of repairs, there are a lot of other little toilet parts that ought to also be well maintained to help prevent leakages and other toilet problems. For example, if you have a 2 piece toilet, the tank to bowl gasket is your very first line of defense versus leaks between the tank and bowl. As it gets worn, it can begin to harden and break or merely be so squished that it doesn't fill the area in addition to it utilized to, and you end up with water all over the location. Much like with the gasket, in some cases your tank to bowl bolts and washers can become corroded or so used that they spring a leak. We highly recommend also changing your gasket and your bolt set to make sure whatever is in tip-top shape Whenever you replace your flush valve.</p>
