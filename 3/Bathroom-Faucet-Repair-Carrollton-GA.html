Soft water feels visibly smooth to the skin. It also makes your home simple to clean by minimizing hard-water build-up. High water pressure also harms plumbing. The water entering the house puts excess pressure on faucet seal, water shut down valves and supply lines, and toilets.

<p>To help avoid blockages within the tee (an effect of the baffle inside ), some plumbers will link the disposer discharge straight to the tee of an end-outlet constant waste, instead of use the approach laid out above. It's easy for waste from the disposer to clog it up because the baffle effectively cuts in half the interior size of the tee. When the waste needs to travel horizontally (down the arm) and then change direction to fall down the trap, this is especially real. Having the disposer discharge directly down into the tee allows for a direct line to the trap that's relatively friction-free. In this set-up, a waste arm runs between the other sink drain and the tee.</p>
