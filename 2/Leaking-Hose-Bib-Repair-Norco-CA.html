<p>Unlike salt-based water softeners which use a process called ion exchange to eliminate hard water minerals, salt-free water softeners use a physical procedure called Template Assisted Crystallization (TAC). This process converts the hardness-causing minerals in the water to a hardness crystal that won't stay with any surface in your home, keeping your home appliances and warm water heaters without hard water scale build up. Salt-free softeners are likewise known as water conditioners because they do not in fact soften" the water; They condition (or reduce the effects of) it. And due to the fact that these types of systems do not trap any minerals, there's no need for a cleaning cycle to remove recorded ions.</p>
