<h3>What Causes Pipe and Drain Clogs in Norwell MA?</h3>
<p>Try to find a jam. Something too hard to grind, such as a piece of glass, might be jamming the motor. Shut off the power and water, then unplug the disposal (If it's hardwired, switch off the breaker.) Get rid of the rubber baffle inside the drain-most simply lift out-and shine a flashlight into the hole. Fish out the obstruction with a pair of tongs or needle-nose pliers. For example, backflow can occur when there's a break in the main water line or when a fire hydrant is opened for usage. Water is no longer being pressed forward into your home and will stream backwards into the city water lines since pressure is lost throughout these events.</p>
<p>Your primary step is to shut off the water. For the most part, you'll have a shutoff valve right next to the toilet coming either through the floor or out of the wall. If you do not have a shutoff, shut off the water supply at the main shutoff valve, where water enters your home. This is a great time to add a shutoff valve next to the toilet or replace one that leaks. This is also a good time to replace the supply line that feeds your toilet (Image 6). A versatile supply line strengthened with a metal sleeve costs about $7 in your home centers and hardware shops. Photos 1 - 8 show how to replace the valve. If the height of your valve is adjustable, set the height prior to you install the valve (Picture 5). Inspect the directions if your valve is a various design from the one we show. After mounting the valve (Image 6), connect the fill tube (Picture 7).</p>
