<p>Sluggish drains. A slow drain can be a common plumbing issue, and many obstructions can be resolved with a basic fix such as a plunger or drain cleaning. If the basic unclogging techniques do not work to solve the slow drain, the issue can be a deeper clog someplace in the main sewer line. Unfortunately, mainline obstructions are typically much bigger blockages than need more than basic unclogging approaches, however digging into the line itself to access the source of the issue.</p>
<p>Our kitchen sink clogged over the weekend.  Given that I enjoy to prepare, I generate a whole lot of dishes. We set up a temporary workaround at our guest bathroom sink, but after a day of this we understood that we needed the sink repaired ASAP.  Fritz remained in and out of the home within thirty minutes and he guarantees that the sink will remain clog-free for thirty days. If it obstructs once again within that time, he will come out and fix it for free - that is what I call service!
