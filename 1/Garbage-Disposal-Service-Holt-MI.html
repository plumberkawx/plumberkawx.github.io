<p>Those people in the market understand that cross-connection programs in many areas have greatly decreased the variety of reported incidents that take place within our water supply. This has at times led to people thinking that backflow issues and problems no longer exist or that there might never ever really have been a problem in the very first location.

Every system might not need a decreased pressure principle backflow assembly.  In far a lot of locations we have an all or nothing approach to backflow defense. We need to take a look at each installation for the threat it provides and then install the proper defense.</p>
