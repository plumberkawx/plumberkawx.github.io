<p>On May 1st of 2007 WSSC Water adopted the International Plumbing and Fuel Gas Codes. Subsequently residential authorizations provided after that date need a testable backflow assembly for the fire sprinkler system. The assembly was checked at installation and a WSSC Water test tag with the date it was tested was attached. By code this backflow assembly must be checked each year. Also permits issued for sub-meters with backflow preventers for lawn irrigation systems require an every year test. It is required that this assembly is tested in the spring before running the irrigation system. All testable backflow preventers must be checked annually to guarantee the security of the safe and clean drinking water in your house.
