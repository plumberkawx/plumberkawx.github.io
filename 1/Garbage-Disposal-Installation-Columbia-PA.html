<p>There's no part of your house that has more of a direct impact on your safety, convenience, comfort, and dependability than your plumbing system. Your water is brown or red.

<p>To assist prevent clogs within the tee (a repercussion of the baffle inside ), some plumbers will link the disposer discharge directly to the tee of an end-outlet constant waste, instead of use the method laid out above. Since the baffle efficiently cuts in half the interior diameter of the tee, it's easy for waste from the disposer to clog it up. When the waste must take a trip horizontally (down the arm) and then change direction to fall down the trap, this is especially real. Having the disposer discharge directly down into the tee permits a direct line to the trap that's reasonably friction-free. In this set-up, a waste arm runs in between the other sink drain and the tee.</p>
