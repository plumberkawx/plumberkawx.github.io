<p>Storage facilities and rise tanks are generally installed at the terminus of the water conveyance system, typically between and aqueduct and the circulation water mains. These are centers designed for the short-term staging of water products and consist of water towers, tanks, cisterns, secondary tanks, and lined ponds. These are best considered flow regulators rather than water storage units. Considering that water demand differs throughout the day while the pipe circulation rates from the water source stay approximately consistent, usage never exactly matches supply. As so for those durations where water circulation is greater than demand (generally night-time hours), the excess water system is safely and easily saved for later use when demand rate exceeds supply (typically throughout the work day, though with some variations from morning to afternoon and evening).</p>
