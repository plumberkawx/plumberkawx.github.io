<p>Searching for prompt Albuquerque emergency plumbing services? The third main component of a water softening system is the salt water tank. The brine tank is generally a storage tank for salt chloride (NaCl) or potassium chloride (KCL) which is mixed with water during the salt water refill and regrowth cycles. This brine (a focused solution of seawater) is drawn back into the mineral tank during the regrowth stage to renew the softener bed. The salt or potassium chloride is a sacrificial media and must be renewed on a regular basis to guarantee adequate softening form the device.</p>
<p>A water softener draws magnesium and calcium out of the water in order to "soften" it. But to do so, it needs to put something back into the water. Many water softeners utilize an ion exchange process where calcium and magnesium ions are exchanged for salt ions in the system's resin tank. This tank is filled with resin beads, and the firmness ions (calcium and magnesium) attach themselves to these. The tank flushes itself when specific levels are fulfilled, and the system will need to have the salt in the brine tank replenished.</p>
