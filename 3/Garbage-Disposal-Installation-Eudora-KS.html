<p>Finally, the most sophisticated and complex backflow preventer is the minimized pressure zone device. This device includes no less than five independently running valves (2 check valves and a differential relief valve sealed off at both ends by water tight valves). Each valve functions as a back up system to the other 4. During standard water flows at style pressure, the 2 check valves stay open and the relief valve is closed. The relief valve will spring open if either check valve is clogged and wedged open by particles or if siphonage occurs to the linked service pipeline. To prevent backflow, the downstream check valve will close. Such a advanced and reliable  (if expensive) device is best used in important areas where cross contamination might be a direct risk to life and health.</p>
