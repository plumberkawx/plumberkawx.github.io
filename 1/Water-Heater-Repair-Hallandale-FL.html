If it was developed prior to 1970, it might have pipes made from an outdated material that will start to provide you problems in the not-too-distant future (if they haven't currently).

These newer systems, likewise referred to as demand-initiated regrowth softeners, are ideal due to the fact that they conserve energy and cash-- using less water and salt for regeneration.</p>
