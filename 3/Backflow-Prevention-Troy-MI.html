<p>For the purpose of water treatment, solidity is determined in either grains per gallon (gpg) or parts per million (ppm). Grains per gallon is specified as one grain (64.8 mg) of calcium carbonate (CaCO3) dissolved in one US gallon (3.785 l) of water. Parts per million is defined as one milligram of calcium carbonate (CaCO3) per litre of water. To convert between gpg and ppm use the list below aspect; 1 gpg = 17.1 ppm.

<p>A partial reroute is generally a small scale repiping of several afflicted locations of the plumbing below the slab. In cases where fixing the pipe and jackhammering are not cost efficient, it is possible to only desert the affected section of pipe and reroute the line through the ceilings, walls and attics. Costing less than a full repipe, the end outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak once again in the future. We have actually experienced homes having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can add up in cost really quickly. This is the main reason why we will suggest a full repipe in certain neighborhoods, based on our experience.</p>
