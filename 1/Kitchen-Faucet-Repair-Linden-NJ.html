The disposer unit is heavy and can be uncomfortable to steer below the sink. Utilize a big bowl or other strong object to prop up the unit as you place it. Water softeners normally have a life expectancy of 15 years, however, water softener systems can last a lot longer if they are properly preserved. Making sure the salt water tank never ever runs out of salt will extend the system's life.  Protecting the resin bed from high levels of iron and manganese will likewise protect the unit. Iron will foul the resin and lower its ion exchange efficiency. Resin cleaners improve the regrowth cycle and help relieve the resin beads of hardness-causing minerals.</p>
