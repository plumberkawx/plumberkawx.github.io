<h3>What To Do About Burst Pipes In The Middle Of The Night Montclair CA</h3>
<p>Polybutylene Pipe Repair & Replacement: Polybutylene pipe is gray plastic water supply line pipe that was developed in the 1970s. It was really promoted as the pipe of the future. It cost less than copper and was much easier to install. Regrettably, any house that plumbed with polybutylene resembles a ticking time bomb. It is not a concern of if it will leak, but when. A clogged or backed up drain pipe is an issue. Often a house owner can unclog a drain with a commercial product or with a plunger. In some cases unclogging a drain takes taking apart the plug and putting a hook down to pull out hair and gunk. And sometimes even then nothing gets that drain cleared, not even basing on one's head and muttering necromancies to the drain gods.</p>
<p>Our service technicians are experienced in both gas and electrical water heater repair and installation. You might be better off with a new water heater if the damage is significant enough.
