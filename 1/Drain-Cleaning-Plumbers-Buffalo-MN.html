<p>Many toilets utilized today operate with a standard gravity flushing style, suggesting they utilize the force of the gravity to press the clean water into the bowl and then on into the sewer system. Recently, however, toilets using a vacuum flushing system have been appearing in a growing number of houses. This system uses a vacuum-assisted flushing mechanism to draw the water into the bowl and down into the sewers. A disadvantage of this device is that it's a lot more tough to unclog your toilet were to become clogged.</p>

<p>If you're buying a new toilet, you need to understand the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the large bulk of toilets, the drain is focused about 12 in. from the wall. But with a couple of designs, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To check the rough-in, simply determine from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. Toilet shopping will be a bit harder if that measurement (plus the density of the baseboard) isn't roughly 12 in.. Many house centers bring only one or 2 10-in. designs and no 14-in. designs. If you have to special-order a toilet, be prepared to spend a lot more. If there's a door near the toilet, also measure how far the bowl protrudes from the wall. If you are changing a toilet with a basic bowl with an elongated" design, the door may not close. Read on to learn how to install a toilet.</p>
