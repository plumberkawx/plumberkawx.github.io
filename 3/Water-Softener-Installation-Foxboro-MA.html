<p>Soft drink dispensers (post-mix carbonators) utilize carbonated water mixed under pressure with syrup and water to offer soft drinks beverages. Numerous, if not most, pipes are made of copper.

This copper-carbonate solution (i.e. Carbonic Acid) has been shown to be a risk to the gastrointestinal system. The Universal Plumbing Code needs that the authorized backflow prevention for a post-mix carbonator be a reduced pressure backflow assembly (RPZ).

<h3>Emergency Plumbing Service And Maintenance Foxboro MA</h3>

<p>Another downside of water softening through ion exchange is the possible health danger for individuals on low salt diet plans. Ion exchange increases the quantity of sodium in water, in order to reduce its mineral material. Usually, this process adds 7.5 milligrams of salt per quart of water, depending upon how hard the water was to start with. More difficult water will lead to more sodium, as there will be more sodium ions exchanged for mineral ions. For the majority of people, this increase in salt is minor, but if you have actually been advised by a physician to follow a rigorous low sodium diet this boost can present problems.</p>
