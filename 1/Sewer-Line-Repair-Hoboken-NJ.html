<p>Almost all softeners fall into one of two classifications. Timed designs have programmable timeclocks that will restore on an established schedule and after that go back to service. These work well for households that are on routine water-using cycles but will waste more water and salt because they regrow whether the resin needs it or not. Demand-control designs, with either electrical and mechanical sensing units, normally regrow after a lot of gallons of water have actually been softened. Such designs are convenient if you have an ever-changing water use schedule.</p>
<p>Water softeners can be found in all sizes and shapes and bigger definitely does not imply much better.
