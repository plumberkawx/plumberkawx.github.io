<p>A partial reroute is generally a little scale repiping of several affected locations of the plumbing beneath the slab. In cases where repairing the pipe and jackhammering are not cost efficient, it is possible to only desert the affected section of pipe and reroute the line through the attics, ceilings and walls. Costing less than a full repipe, completion result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak once again in the future. We have experienced houses having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can build up in cost very rapidly.
