<p>The United States Department of Energy says that water heating can represent 14% -25% of the energy consumed in your house." It is the second highest energy consuming area of a home, next to heating and cooling. The quantity of minerals dissolved in water can trigger it to take longer for water to heat, increasing those energy expenses.
