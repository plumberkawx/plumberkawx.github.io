<p>A freshly installed water heater ought to not produce odd noises, but it will begin to produce rumbling sounds as it ages. The sounds get louder with time as the heater goes to heat up the water.

If the water heater still produces rumbling noises even after it has been flushed, a water heater replacement might be needed.</p>

<p>Water that has actually been completely demineralized (such as RO and DI water) is hungry for ions. This is what makes demineralized water-- or water in which all TDS have been removed-- destructive. For this reason, WQA suggests that typical metal pipe and fittings (e.g., copper, galvanized, brass, bronze) ought to not be used downstream of a RO or DI treatment system. Softeners do not eliminate the TDS and do not cause this kind of deterioration A softener is just capturing some cations (primarily calcium and magnesium) and releasing other cations at the same time (normally sodium or sometimes potassium).</p>
