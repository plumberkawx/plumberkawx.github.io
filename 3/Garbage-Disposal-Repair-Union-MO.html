Plumbers will likewise inspect the toilets in the house. Running toilets are a sign of a leaking seal inside of the toilet and if left untreated, can lose thousands of gallons of water per day.</p>
<p>More complicated is the double check valve assembly (DCVA). This device has actually discovered extensive use considering that it prevents both siphonage and back pressure.

<p>Caution: If used on a water supply where a pump and pressure tank provides the water (like is used on a lot of rural houses that have a well), the PVB may spit water each time the pump turns off. Because the pressure variations caused by the pump and pressure tank system can cause backflow from the irrigation system back into the water system, this is. The probability of water spitting, and the amount of water that spits out, both increase with a longer mainline on the irrigation system. So if you have 10 feet (3m) of mainline between the PVB and the farthest valve there is less most likely to be water spitting than if you have 500 feet (150m) of mainline pipe. One way to stop, or a minimum of decrease, this water spillage is to install a spring-loaded check valve right after the PVB. The PVB may still spill a little water with the check valve set up, nevertheless in most cases it should be much less water.</p>
