As water trickles through rocks, limestone deposits and soil, it gets these minerals on its journey. Depending on for how long the water travels through the ground before reaching your tap, it can get a great deal of these minerals, making water harder in some areas than others. While the minerals won't harm your health, they can leave insoluble mineral deposits, making the water unsuitable-- and rather a problem-- for its numerous designated uses around your house.</p>
