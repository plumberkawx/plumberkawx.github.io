Older toilets might work just fine, but if your toilet is really old (and obsoleted in style), you may want to think about a toilet replacement service by Vegas Valley Plumbing.

<p>If you're purchasing a brand-new toilet, you need to understand the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the large majority of toilets, the drain is focused about 12 in. from the wall. But with a couple of models, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To check the rough-in, just determine from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. Toilet shopping will be a bit harder if that measurement (plus the thickness of the baseboard) isn't around 12 in.. Many home centers bring only one or 2 10-in. designs and no 14-in. models. If you need to special-order a toilet, be prepared to spend far more. If there's a door near the toilet, likewise measure how far the bowl extends from the wall.
