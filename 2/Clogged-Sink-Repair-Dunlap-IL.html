<h3>Plumber Plumbing Contractor Dunlap IL</h3>
<p>Caution: If used on a water supply where a pump and pressure tank supplies the water (like is used on a lot of rural houses that have a well), the PVB might spit water each time the pump shuts down. Since the pressure variations caused by the pump and pressure tank system can trigger backflow from the watering system back into the water system, this is. The probability of water spitting, and the amount of water that spits out, both boost with a longer mainline on the watering system. So if you have 10 feet (3m) of mainline in between the PVB and the farthest valve there is less likely to be water spitting than if you have 500 feet (150m) of mainline pipe. One method to stop, or a minimum of lower, this water spillage is to install a spring-loaded check valve right after the PVB. The PVB might still spill a little water with the check valve set up, however for the most part it should be much less water.</p>
