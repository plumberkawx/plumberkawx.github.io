<p>Gradually, like any other device in your house, your waste disposal unit. might require repairs. A disposal system might start or clog to leak through heavy, or incorrect, use.

<p>Where the company lies: Beware of contractors who offer you a post workplace box with no street address or use only an answering service.

Grey = End-User Pressure - water pushes past the # 2 check valve into the system of the end user. The # 2 Check avoids backflow triggered by pressure increases in the down stream plumbing.</p>
