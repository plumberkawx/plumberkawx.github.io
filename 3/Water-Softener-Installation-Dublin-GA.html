Backflow is the unwanted circulation of water or other liquids, mixes, gasses or compounds into the drinking water supply. In a lot of states, except Kansas, you are responsible for any gas piping on your property from our gas meter to your house or company. Atmos Energy does not keep the gas lines on your property beyond our meter, this is the exact same as other utilities, such as your electrical wiring and water pipes.</p>
