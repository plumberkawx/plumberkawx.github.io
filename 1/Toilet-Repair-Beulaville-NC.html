<p>Aiming to repair or replace your garbage disposal? At Service Professor, gas line repairs are more than an added service that we offer. They are a specific area that our specialists excel in. We understand how important gas lines are and how deadly a leak can be. We make certain you understand the risks as well. That's why you ought to only rely on a professional that understands the details of working with gas lines. A garbage disposal will last 10 to 12-years, and many service warranties cover the very first 2 to 5-years. When purchasing a new unit, keep this in mind.</p>
<p>It's also a good idea to have your toilet inspected if it was manufactured before 1994, as older toilets are generally much less efficient than more recent designs. You might be squandering hundreds of gallons of water and hundreds of dollars on an inefficient toilet. If you wish to put brand-new pipes in your home or you're developing a house, there are 3 kinds of brand-new plumbing pipe available that are building-code approved for homes-- copper, PEX, and CPVC (chlorinated polyvinyl chloride). PEX and CPVC are both plastics and are exceptional alternatives to the expensive copper piping.</p>

<p>In some cases you know you have a sewer line break since you can smell foul odors or you have a sewage back-up in your house. It is very important to identify the specific location of the break in your sewer line. Oftentimes the break can be on the city side of the sewer line and knowing this can save you countless dollars in repairs. Merely sharing a copy of your sewer line video with the city inspector can fix the problem. The technicians and plumbers at Jim Dandy Sewer and Plumbing can make a copy of your sewer scope video on a thumb drive so that you always have a copy for your insurance coverage city, realtor or company inspector.</p>
<p>There are 2 excellent factors to insist on a sewer camera inspection of your hygienic and storm sewer before buying. If the house that you have your eye on is an older home in a mature neighborhood you most likely have bigger trees on or near the property.  Unfortunately where there are trees there are normally tree roots and they like to find water within your sewer. There is no chance of knowing whether you have a tree root problem without seeing it with a camera inspection. You can chance and await the very first rainstorm but I believe you 'd rather not.</p>
