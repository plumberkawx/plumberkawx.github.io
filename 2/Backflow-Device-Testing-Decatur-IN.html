<h3>Find Registered Plumbers in  Decatur IN</h3>
<p>Caution: If used on a water supply where a pump and pressure tank supplies the water (like is used on many rural houses that have a well), the PVB may spit water each time the pump turns off. This is because the pressure variations triggered by the pump and pressure tank system can cause backflow from the irrigation system back into the water supply. The possibility of water spitting, and the amount of water that spits out, both increase with a longer mainline on the watering system. So if you have 10 feet (3m) of mainline between the PVB and the farthest valve there is less most likely to be water spitting than if you have 500 feet (150m) of mainline pipe. One way to stop, or a minimum of reduce, this water spillage is to install a spring-loaded check valve right after the PVB. The PVB might still spill a little water with the check valve installed, however in many cases it must be much less water.</p>
<p>Older houses frequently have actually threaded steel gas pipe. If your old appliance is connected with a steel gas pipe and you're setting up a new home appliance, buy a gas appliance linking set and replace the steel gas pipe with the flexible gas supply lines stainless steel tube. But remember, you can't link the flare fitting on the versatile gas line supply straight to a steel pipe thread. You have to install the flare fitting that's included with the kit.</p>
