When the waste should travel horizontally (down the arm) and then change direction to fall down the trap, this is particularly real. Having the disposer discharge directly down into the tee enables a direct line to the trap that's relatively friction-free. In this set-up, a waste arm runs in between the other sink drain and the tee.</p>
