New meters need to satisfy policies and code requirements for their placement, and gas service providers might need a special meter for their services, restricting your choices. Do-it-yourselfers and contractors are accountable for scheduling inspections by calling the office number noted on the building permit. Inspections need to be made after structure excavation (prior to putting concrete), after rough-in (before hiding work), and upon completion. NOTE: If defective work is discovered, the inspector will provide an infraction notice, and a specific amount of time is allocated to fix the problem.</p>

<p>Once the parts are put back into the body, the backflow prevention assembly is all set to be pressurized. It is essential to turn the inlet shut-off valve on slowly while the downside turned off remains in the closed position. This permits the parts to relocate to their pressurized positions in an exact movement. When the assembly is pressurized, then any collected air should be removed from the body. Most backflow prevention assemblies have air bleeds or air screws so that air can be removed from crucial locations in the assembly. In some designs, test dicks can be used to remove air from an assembly if they are near the top of the body or in an area where the air will accumulate.</p>
