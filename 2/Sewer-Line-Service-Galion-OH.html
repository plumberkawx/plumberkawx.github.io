<h3>Water Heater Repair: When to Do It Yourself, and When to Call the Pros in Galion OH</h3>
<p>Sodium intake from softened water can be prevented by leaving one kitchen tap unsoftened for drinking and cooking. Substituting potassium chloride for sodium chloride might be proper if health or environmental reasons demand limiting salt. In time, the beads end up being coated with minerals and have to be cleaned up. This cleaning process, called regrowth, has three cycles: backwash, recharge and rinse. The regrowth process can be scheduled instantly with an electric timer, through a mechanical water meter, or a computer.</p>
<p>Your primary step is to shut off the water. In many cases, you'll have a shutoff valve right next to the toilet coming either through the floor or out of the wall. If you don't have a shutoff, switch off the supply of water at the main shutoff valve, where water enters your house. This is a good time to include a shutoff valve next to the toilet or replace one that leaks. This is also a good time to replace the supply line that feeds your toilet (Photo 6). A flexible supply line enhanced with a metal sleeve costs about $7 in your home centers and hardware shops. Pictures 1 - 8 show how to replace the valve. If the height of your valve is adjustable, set the height before you install the valve (Photo 5). Inspect the directions if your valve is a various style from the one we show. After installing the valve (Picture 6), connect the fill tube (Image 7).</p>
