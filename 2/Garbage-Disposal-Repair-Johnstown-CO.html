<p>Pipeline leak detection is used to identify if and in some cases where a leak has happened in systems which contain gases and liquids. Most plumbers, steamfitters, and pipefitters discover their trade through a 4- or 5-year apprenticeship. Apprentices usually receive 2,000 hours of paid on-the-job training, in addition to some technical guideline, each year. Technical direction consists of security, local plumbing codes and policies, and blueprint reading. Apprentices also study mathematics, applied physics, and chemistry. Apprenticeship programs are sponsored by unions, trade associations, and businesses. The majority of apprentices go into a program directly, however some start out as helpers or finish a pre-apprenticeship training programs in plumbing and other trades.</p>
