<p>So, how does a softener understand when to come down to service? The timing of regeneration depends on the type of softener you have. Softeners with a timer flush and recharge on the basis of a predetermined schedule-- say, 11 p.m. every 3 days, regardless of whether the water in fact requires it. When required, more recent systems use digital sensing units that monitor bead deficiency and other crucial metrics based on your water usage and for that reason just regrow. These more recent systems, likewise referred to as demand-initiated regrowth softeners, are ideal due to the fact that they save energy and cash-- using less water and salt for regeneration.</p>
