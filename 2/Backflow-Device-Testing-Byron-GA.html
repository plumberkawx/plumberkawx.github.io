Again, the very best type of backflow prevention is an air space, such as the outlet of a faucet and where water would stream over the rim of a sink or bathtub. The Warren County Plumbing Department checks to make sure there is an air space, if there is no chance to provide one, then we check to see that the appropriate BFP device is installed.

For this factor, the RPZ should be set up in locations that are exempt to water damage and allow appropriate drainage.</p>
