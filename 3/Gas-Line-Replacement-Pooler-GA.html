<p>Disposers attach to the sink drain fittings in a variety of ways-some use threaded plastic nuts, others big hose clamps-but the mounting-ring assembly shown here is the most typical. To remove the disposer, support it from below and turn the large, 3-tab mounting ring on top counterclockwise until the system falls away. Eliminate the rest of the drain assembly by loosening up the three bolts and prying off the keeping ring. Push the drain out through the sink hole and clear away any old caulk or putty.</p>
