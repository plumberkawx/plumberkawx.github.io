<p>If you are updating your gas devices, you should update the piping too. Gas leakages can be scary and unsafe. We're here for you every step of the method. Call (866) 701-5306 to arrange an appointment. A climatic vacuum breaker (AVB) is not a testable backflow preventer and is not typically defined by water purveyors.  It consists of an air inlet valve, check seat, and air inlet port.  In fundamental operational use, water pressure pushes the seat up and blocks the air inlet.  When the water circulation stops, it falls back down to open the air inlet port and breaks the vacuum, allowing the device to drain as well as preventing back siphonage.  The word siphonage" is very crucial here.  This device just breaks the vacuum to drain water and will not protect against back pressure.  Think of this device as a frost-proof hose bibb with a vacuum breaker.  It also has to lie a minimum of 6 inches above any overflow rim or downstream piping.</p>

A clogged drain can even lead to sluggish water drainage, flooding, sewage backup, and expensive repairs.</p>
