When the water circulation stops, it falls back down to open the air inlet port and breaks the vacuum, allowing the device to drain along with avoiding back siphonage.  The word siphonage" is very important here.  This device only breaks the vacuum to drain water and will not protect against back pressure.  Think about this device as a frost-proof hose bibb with a vacuum breaker.  It also needs to be located a minimum of 6 inches above any overflow rim or downstream piping.</p>
