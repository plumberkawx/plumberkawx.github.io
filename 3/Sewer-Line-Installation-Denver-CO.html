The outcome is a backflow where liquid in the pipe section flows in reverse relative to the instructions of the system's supply of water movement. This opposite flow is typically localized and can result from a loss in upstream pressure from, for instance, physical failure of the pipe wall or its joints. Such physical damage is more common in smaller pipes subject to lorry traffic on overlaying highways, vibrations from surrounding heavy equipment operations, settlement of nearby soil or moving foundations, the wear and tear of pipe appurtenances such as valves and meters, etc. The outcome is a total breakage, dislocation or splitting in the pipe that enables water to leave.
