<p>Siphonage into a pipe system. occurs when there is a decrease in supplied pressure to the water flow. The outcome is a backflow where liquid in the pipe sector flows backwards relative to the direction of the system's water supply movement. This opposite flow is normally localized and can arise from a loss in upstream pressure from, for instance, physical failure of the pipe wall or its joints. Such physical damage is more typical in smaller pipes subject to automobile traffic on overlaying roadways, vibrations from adjacent heavy devices operations, settlement of neighboring soil or moving foundations, the wear and tear of pipe appurtenances such as meters and valves, etc. The outcome is a complete breakage, dislocation or breaking in the pipe that permits water to escape. Sometimes no apparent physical damage to the pipe is required, just the mechanical failure of a key pump whose shut down results in a considerable pressure drop across the pipe network.</p>
