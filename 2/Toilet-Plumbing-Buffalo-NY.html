<p>Identification of liquid, air and gas leakages: Using electronic, acoustical and thermal imaging locating devices to identify leaks. Whether you need waste disposal unit repair or installation, Maeser can help. A waste disposal unit is a necessary kitchen device in a lot of homes today. While a lot of kitchen sink disposers can handle almost any type of food waste, they are not indestructible. When a fork, bone or other item jams the impeller or shredding ring, the disposal will stop running. Used impellers on older disposals can become inefficient, increasing the risk of drain obstructions.</p>
<p>It is an excellent concept to have your pipes checked every five years to see how they're holding up. When pipes begin to go, it is essential to have them switched out right away to prevent leaks and pipe bursts, both of which can do costly damage to your house. Keep in mind that pipes do not have a "hectic season," they see regular use year round. Schedule service today and begin keeping a record of their maintenance history if you can't remember the last time you had your pipes looked at.</p>
