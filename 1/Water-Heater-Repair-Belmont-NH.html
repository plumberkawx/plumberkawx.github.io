<p>Hot water heater repair can sometimes be cost-prohibitive. You'll spend for the required repairs only to deal with another problem shortly afterwards. Always continue to run water during and after using your disposal. Preferably, flushing it with cold water for 30 seconds after the waste has actually disappeared down the drain. The flywheel is jammed: If the disposal hums when you flip the switch, however it doesn't grind up food, this suggests the flywheel is stuck. Try releasing the jam by inserting a hex wrench of the correct size into the hole on the bottom of the waste disposal unit. Alternately, you can prod the flywheel by sticking a broom deal with (not your fingers!) into the sink.</p>
