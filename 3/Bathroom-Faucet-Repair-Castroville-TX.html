Usually, it is possible to do the bulk of the work that requires complete water shut off while you are out and about during the day, so you experience very little disturbance to your day-to-day regimen. To start the repiping procedure, the plumbing group will first cover any carpet and furniture to secure them from dust and particles. They will then make small cuts in the wall and drywall to find the pipes and then get rid of and replace them, leaving as much of the original building material as possible intact.</p>
