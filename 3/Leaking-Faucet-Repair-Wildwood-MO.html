The test period will not be less than 10 minutes. The piping system shall withstand the test pressure specified without showing any evidence of leak or other problems. Mechanical assesses utilized to determine test pressures shall have a range such that the greatest end of the scale is not greater than five times the test pressure. For instance, a 3 psi test will require a maximum 15 pound gauge. A 10 psi test might be performed utilizing a 50 pound gauge, but not a 100 pound gauge. The piping system will be under test (pressurized) and the test gauge visible at the time of inspection. Where the gauge does not indicate the minimum pressure required for the test, or any reduction of test pressures as suggested by pressure determines during inspection shall be deemed to suggest the existence of a leak.</p>
