<p>A license and inspections are needed for the majority of residential tasks consisting of porches, additions, and equipment such as a/c and hot water heater. A strategy may be needed to acquire the license if new work is performed such as replacement of gas piping. Ultimately, you'll need to depend on a relied on plumber to encourage you whether it's time for a pipe replacement. And it's always great to get a second and even 3rd  viewpoint before you embark on a replacement project. But there are a few methods you can alleviate the cost and inconvenience of the task.</p>

If you have not done so currently, we suggest installing carbon monoxide gas detectors outside of bed room doors to alert you of any prospective gas leakages.</p>
