<p>Running a gas line to a grill or fire pit costs $20 per foot, or $200 to $700 usually depending upon the length from the main gas line. Installing a gas line for a grill costs $99 to $600, while a fire pit that's out in the yard costs $300 to $1,400. You could have a problem with high water pressure if your water heater stops working due to sediment build up in the tank. The water pressure builds and might ultimately trigger the tank to explode. This causes countless dollars in water and home damage to your home.</p>
