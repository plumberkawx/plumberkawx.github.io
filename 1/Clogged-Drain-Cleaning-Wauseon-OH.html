<p>A partial reroute is essentially a little scale repiping of one or more affected locations of the plumbing underneath the slab. In cases where jackhammering and fixing the pipe are not cost efficient, it is possible to just desert the affected area of pipe and reroute the line through the ceilings, walls and attics. Costing less than a full repipe, the end outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak again in the future. We have actually experienced homes having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can accumulate in cost very rapidly.

All possible or existing cross connections should be secured from backflow by the installation of a proper backflow prevention device. Consult Public Health for more particular information on code requirements.</p>
