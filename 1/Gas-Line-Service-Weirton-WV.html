It is very important to turn the inlet shut-off valve on gradually while the disadvantage shut down stays in the closed position. This enables the parts to transfer to their pressurized positions in a precise motion. As soon as the assembly is pressurized, then any collected air needs to be eliminated from the body.

Most residential water heaters cost $150 to $400 for either gas or electrical, plus $200 to $450 if you have a plumber install it. More pricey gas water heaters with unique venting systems also are available. But they're more difficult to install, and we won't deal with them here.</p>
