<p>Yes, anywhere connections are or can be made in between the drinkable water supply and non-potable water or compounds a backflow assembly is required to be installed. An authorized, properly installed and kept backflow assembly essentially eliminates the threat of backflow from either backpressure or backsiphonage. Electric hot water heater have a shorter lifespan than gas water heaters of comparable quality and capability.

After all, you called us to fix your piping problems, not your pocketbook.</p>
<p>A water heater installation is not the repair on which to develop your plumbing skills if you're fairly unskilled. So save yourself some major problem by being truthful with yourself about where your experience level is.

Getting rid of the backflow preventer to repair it is not needed for the most part. Some components such as relief valve bodies may need to be removed from the main body to help with a repair. Knowing the correct order for disassembly of the backflow preventer can be crucial.</p>
