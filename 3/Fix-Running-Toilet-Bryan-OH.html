<h3>Water Heater Issues and Repair at Bryan OH</h3>
<p>Yes, anywhere connections are or can be made between the potable water system and non-potable water or substances a backflow assembly is needed to be installed. An authorized, correctly set up and kept backflow assembly essentially removes the risk of backflow from either backpressure or backsiphonage. Electric water heaters have a much shorter lifespan than gas water heaters of similar quality and capacity. Still, the distinction is insufficient to make any significant modifications in the savings a gas heater will bring. Where a gas heater may last 8-15 years, the electric alternative will last about 8-12 years.</p>
