<p>A partial reroute is generally a little scale repiping of one or more affected locations of the plumbing underneath the slab.

Costing less than a complete repipe, the end outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak again in the future. We have experienced homes having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can build up in cost very rapidly.
