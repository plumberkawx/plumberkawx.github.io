<h3>Residential Plumbing Contractor Cary NC</h3>
<p>Sewer camera inspection is an innovative, professional technique of performing an inspection and leak detection services on the plumbing system at your property. Throughout sewer camera inspection, our professional will find an access point to your sewer line and then place a high-definition camera that provides a feedback to the specialist as it travels through the pipeline. Aging: If your hot water heater isn't working like it utilized to and it is at or above 10-15 years of age, it might be time to replace your system. Water heaters just have a life expectancy of 10-15 years. It's probably more affordable to replace rather than repair if your unit is hitting that age range.</p>
<p>Another disadvantage of water softening through ion exchange is the prospective health risk for individuals on low salt diets. Ion exchange increases the amount of salt in water, in order to reduce its mineral content. Usually, this process includes 7.5 milligrams of sodium per quart of water, depending upon how difficult the water was to begin with. More difficult water will result in more salt, as there will be more salt ions exchanged for mineral ions. For many people, this boost in sodium is small, however if you have actually been recommended by a medical professional to follow a rigorous low salt diet this increase can position problems.</p>
