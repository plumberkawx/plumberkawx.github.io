<p>Unless your bathroom remodelling is purely cosmetic in nature, bathroom plumbing may very well become part of your task requirements. Water goes into the top of the water-softener tank and percolates down through the resin beads. The resin has a negative charge, which attracts the favorably charged minerals in the water (a procedure called, ion exchange). The mineral deposits hold on to the resin and the now-softened water exits the softener tank and flows throughout your house. Tankless technology makes good sense. Once you understand the benefits, it's easy to see why homeowners in Charlotte, North Carolina, pick these items over traditional water tanks. By changing to a tankless model, you'll take pleasure in unlimited hot water, smaller utility expenses and more area in your utility closet. There are many reasons to go tankless.
