Finally, the water goes to the holding tank after going through one last stage of filtration to remove any leftover impurities.</p>

<p>Ultraviolet disinfection systems utilize UV light to destroy micro-organisms and provide cleansed water. The energy source needed to warm the water is less costly. Calcium (Ca2+) and magnesium (Mg2+) ions that trigger water hardness can be eliminated fairly easily by using an ion exchange treatment. Basic water softeners are cation exchange devices. Cations describe favorably charged ions dissolved in the water. Cation exchange involves the replacement of the solidity ions with a nonhardness ion.</p>
<p>Storage centers and surge tanks are typically set up at the terminus of the water conveyance system, generally between and aqueduct and the circulation water mains. These are centers designed for the short-term staging of water products and consist of water towers, tanks, cisterns, secondary tanks, and lined ponds. These are best thought of as circulation regulators rather than water storage systems. Because water need differs throughout the day while the pipe flow rates from the water source stay approximately continuous, use never ever precisely matches supply. As so for those periods where water circulation is greater than need (usually night-time hours), the excess water system is securely and easily kept for later use when demand rate goes beyond supply (generally throughout the work day, though with some variations from early morning to afternoon and evening).</p>
