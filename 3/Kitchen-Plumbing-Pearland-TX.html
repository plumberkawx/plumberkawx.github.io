<p>Backflow is the undesirable reversal of flow of water which may carry dirty water or other, harmful compounds into the general public water system and personal plumbing.

Backflow can also carry water into your plumbing if it is linked to any outdoors water source. One example would be a garden hose linked to an external faucet with completion left in a mud puddle in a garden area.</p>
