An atmospheric vacuum breaker (AVB) is not a testable backflow preventer and is not typically defined by water purveyors.  It includes an air inlet valve, check seat, and air inlet port.  In standard functional use, water pressure presses the seat up and blocks the air inlet.  When the water flow stops, it falls back down to open the air inlet port and breaks the vacuum, permitting the device to drain along with avoiding back siphonage.  The word siphonage" is extremely important here.  This device only breaks the vacuum to drain water and will not secure against back pressure.
