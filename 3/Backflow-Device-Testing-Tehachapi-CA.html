<p>Your old discharge tube most likely won't be the right length for your new disposal. If it's too long, simply link it to the disposal, mark it and cut it with a hacksaw for your waste disposal unit installation. (Loosen up the other pipe connections, if essential, to insert television back into the tee.) You might have to make a time-wasting trip to the store if the old discharge tube is too short. To avoid this, ensure the new waste disposal unit installation set includes a tube, or purchase one separately at the very same time for about $3.</p>
<p>If you're buying a brand-new toilet, you need to know the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the huge bulk of toilets, the waste pipe is centered about 12 in. from the wall. But with a few models, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To inspect the rough-in, simply measure from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. If that measurement (plus the density of the baseboard) isn't roughly 12 in., toilet shopping will be a bit harder. The majority of home centers bring just one or more 10-in. designs and no 14-in. designs. If you need to special-order a toilet, be prepared to invest far more. If there's a door near the toilet, likewise measure how far the bowl protrudes from the wall. If you are replacing a toilet with a basic bowl with an elongated" design, the door might not close.
