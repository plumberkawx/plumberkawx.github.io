The repair may be as simple as replacing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may require the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he creates information on the workings of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's task to know what the field test data indicates for that specific assembly.  When a trained tester interprets the data, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and requires repair.</p>
