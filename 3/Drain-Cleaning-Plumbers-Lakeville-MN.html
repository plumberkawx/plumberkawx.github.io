<p>Your old discharge tube probably will not be the best length for your new disposal. If it's too long, just connect it to the disposal, mark it and cut it with a hacksaw for your waste disposal unit installation. (Loosen the other pipe connections, if required, to place the tube back into the tee.) You might have to make a time-wasting trip to the store if the old discharge tube is too brief. To avoid this, make sure the new waste disposal unit installation set includes a tube, or buy one independently at the same time for about $3.</p>
<p>Sadly, when water is completely removed of calcium and magnesium to end up being soft, it typically becomes destructive. Destructive water triggers leaching of copper pipes and faucet components, especially in locations where water sits for extended periods of time.

Most residential hot water heater cost $150 to $400 for either gas or electrical, plus $200 to $450 if you have a plumber install it. More costly gas hot water heater with special venting systems also are offered. But they're more difficult to install, and we won't handle them here.</p>
