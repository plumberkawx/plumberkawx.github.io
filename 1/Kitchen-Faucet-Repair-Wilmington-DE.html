New meters need to fulfill policies and code requirements for their placement, and gas providers might need a special meter for their services, limiting your options. Do-it-yourselfers and contractors are responsible for scheduling inspections by calling the workplace number listed on the structure license. Inspections need to be made after structure excavation (before putting concrete), after rough-in (before concealing work), and upon completion. NOTE: If faulty work is discovered, the inspector will provide a violation notice, and a specific amount of time is allotted to remedy the issue.</p>
