<p>Siphonage into a pipe system. When there is a decrease in supplied pressure to the water circulation, takes place. The result is a backflow where liquid in the pipe section streams backwards relative to the direction of the system's water system movement.

Such physical damage is more typical in smaller pipes subject to automobile traffic on overlaying streets, vibrations from adjacent heavy devices operations, settlement of nearby soil or shifting foundations, the wear and tear of pipe appurtenances such as valves and meters, etc. The outcome is a total damage, dislocation or cracking in the pipe that enables water to get away. Often no apparent physical damage to the pipe is needed, simply the mechanical failure of a key pump whose shut down results in a substantial pressure drop throughout the pipe network.</p>
