<p>What is tough water? Clinically speaking, it is water which contains considerable amounts of liquified minerals, specifically calcium and magnesium. As water trickles through rocks, limestone deposits and soil, it picks up these minerals on its journey. Depending on for how long the water travels through the ground before reaching your tap, it can get a lot of these minerals, making water harder in some regions than others. While the minerals will not damage your health, they can leave insoluble mineral deposits, making the water inappropriate-- and rather an annoyance-- for its many desired uses around your home.</p>
