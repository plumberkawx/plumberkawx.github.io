Call 404-524-1825 for knowledgeable Atlanta, GA repiping services. Backflow occurs anytime water flows through a pipes in the opposite direction that it's suggested to. Backflow is a problem since it can cause wastewater to flow back into a house, contaminating the drinking water. Cover the flapper valve with your hand. Turn on the water (very carefully, so you don't get a cold shower!) and let it flush out the toilet valve for a few seconds.</p>

Jay B and Aaron scoped the task quickly and discussed the tactical plan for diagnosis and repair. They kept me educated and stood firm through very challenging sewer line cleanup and repair. I will suggest SW plumbing for any major repair work.</p>
