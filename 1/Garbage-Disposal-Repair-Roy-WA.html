<p>If you're purchasing a brand-new toilet, you need to understand the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the vast bulk of toilets, the drain is centered about 12 in. from the wall. But with a couple of models, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To check the rough-in, just measure from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. If that measurement (plus the thickness of the baseboard) isn't approximately 12 in., toilet shopping will be a bit harder. The majority of house centers bring just one or more 10-in. designs and no 14-in. designs. If you have to special-order a toilet, be prepared to spend far more. If there's a door near the toilet, also determine how far the bowl extends from the wall. If you are replacing a toilet with a basic bowl with a lengthened" model, the door might not close.
