Such physical damage is more common in smaller sized pipes based on automobile traffic on overlaying roads, vibrations from nearby heavy devices operations, settlement of close-by soil or moving foundations, the wear and tear of pipe appurtenances such as valves and meters, etc. The result is a total breakage, dislocation or splitting in the pipe that permits water to leave.
