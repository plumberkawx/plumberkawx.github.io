<p>The Plumbing Department of the Buildings, Security Engineering and Environmental Department is accountable for ensuring that plumbing systems and competent trade persons are in compliance with code and ordinance requirements. The Plumbing Department evaluates strategies and checks: new building, changes and renovations of plumbing systems. This division is also responsible for releasing plumbing authorizations, and signing up licenses for plumbing contractors and water treatment operators.</p>

Once again, it is suggested to check the producer's instructions for unique safety measures.</p>
