<p>A double check backflow device (DC) is the simplest and most typical kind of device. It has 2 check valves in an entirely closed body-- 2 layers of backflow protection. No matter how big the valve is, all DCs are geared up with 1-pound springs that hold the check valves closed throughout a backflow circumstance. Those 1-pound springs are what you are testing when you ultimately check a backflow preventer. If each check valve holds a differential of 1 pound or more on your backflow gauge, the device passes. That means that the check valve is holding shut with at least 1 pound of force. The disadvantage of a DC is that if the first line of defense stops working and the second line of defense fails (both inspect valves stop working to hold), a backflow scenario might happen. That is why this type of valve is not defined for what a public utility thinks about high risk" establishments.</p>
