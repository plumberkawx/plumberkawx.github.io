<h3>Things To Consider Before Hiring A Plumber Richmond KY</h3>
<p>Caution: If used on a water system where a pump and pressure tank supplies the water (like is utilized on a lot of rural homes that have a well), the PVB might spit water each time the pump shuts off.

One way to stop, or at least minimize, this water spillage is to install a spring-loaded check valve right after the PVB. The PVB may still spill a little water with the check valve installed, nevertheless for the most part it must be much less water.</p>
