<p>Current Review: Button Plumbing was fantastic. They changed my kitchen faucet and included two new shut off valves under the sink which had always leaked in the previous if I shut off the water under the sink. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were very friendly and got the work done quickly. The cost was quite reasonable. I will definitely utilize them for any future plumbing requirements. I was very delighted with their service.</p>
