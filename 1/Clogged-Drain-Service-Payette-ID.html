<p>When your hot water heater develops a leak it can ruin your home.

When carbonated water comes into contact with copper it chemically dissolves the copper from the pipe. This copper-carbonate solution (i.e. Carbonic Acid) has been proven to be a threat to the digestion system. The Universal Plumbing Code needs that the approved backflow prevention for a post-mix carbonator be a lowered pressure backflow assembly (RPZ). Extra requirements: no piping containing copper will be set up downstream of the RPZ backflow assemblies supplying carbonators.</p>
