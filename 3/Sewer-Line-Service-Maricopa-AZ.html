<h3>Unclog Drains, Toilets and Sewers With The Help of Plumbers at Maricopa AZ</h3>
<p>Food scraps compose up to 20% of all household waste. If it can quickly and rapidly be disposed of through the sink, this large amount of garbage does not need to go in the garbage can. A garbage disposal works by shredding the waste into small pieces that are capable of taking a trip through the sewage pipes without impeding water flow. By installing a garbage disposal you are helping the environment by conserving the quantity of trash that gets sent out to land fills and other dumping locations. With a waste disposal unit the garbage is handled through currently existing water facilities.</p>
