Consequently residential authorizations released after that date require a testable backflow assembly for the fire sprinkler system. The assembly was evaluated at installation and a WSSC Water test tag with the date it was tested was connected. By code this backflow assembly must be evaluated yearly. Likewise permits issued for sub-meters with backflow preventers for lawn watering systems need a yearly test. It is required that this assembly is evaluated in the spring prior to running the watering system. All testable backflow preventers need to be evaluated yearly to guarantee the security of the drinkable drinking water in your home.
