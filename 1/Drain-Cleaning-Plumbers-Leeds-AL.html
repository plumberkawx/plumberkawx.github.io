<p>Recent Review: Button Plumbing was fantastic. If I shut off the water under the sink, they changed my kitchen faucet and added two new shut off valves under the sink which had always leaked in the previous. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were very friendly and got the work done quickly. The cost was rather reasonable. I will certainly use them for any future plumbing needs.
