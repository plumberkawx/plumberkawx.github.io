<p>You'll need an unique waste disposal unit if you home uses a septic tank and drain field. The unit needs to grind the waste even finer to avoid clogs and enable the tank to be able to drain correctly into the leach fields. When, the gas pipe shows up from the ground (called the riser"), it can continue to be wrapped, however must then transition to galvanized. I am unsure why that must be.

Whenever you replace your flush valve, we highly recommend also changing your gasket and your bolt set to make sure whatever is in tip-top shape.</p>
