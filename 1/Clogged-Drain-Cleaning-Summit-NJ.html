<p>On May 1st of 2007 WSSC Water embraced the International Plumbing and Fuel Gas Codes. Consequently residential authorizations released after that date need a testable backflow assembly for the fire lawn sprinkler. The assembly was tested at installation and a WSSC Water test tag with the date it was tested was connected. By code this backflow assembly must be checked each year. Also permits provided for sub-meters with backflow preventers for lawn watering systems require a yearly test. It is required that this assembly is tested in the spring prior to operating the irrigation system. All testable backflow preventers should be evaluated every year to guarantee the security of the drinkable drinking water in your house.
