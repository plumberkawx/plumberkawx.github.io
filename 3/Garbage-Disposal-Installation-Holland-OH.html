<p>A lot of toilets utilized today run with a standard gravity flushing design, suggesting they utilize the force of the gravity to press the clean water into the bowl and then on into the sewage system. Just recently, however, toilets using a vacuum flushing system have been appearing in more and more houses.

Look at the cost per ranked year to make an educated choice. Just divide the cost of the water heater by the number of years it is rated for and that will show you the best value.</p>
