These are centers developed for the short-term staging of water products and consist of water towers, tanks, cisterns, secondary reservoirs, and lined ponds. These are best considered circulation regulators rather than water storage systems. Because water need differs throughout the day while the pipe circulation rates from the water source stay approximately constant, usage never exactly matches supply. As so for those periods where water circulation is higher than demand (normally night-time hours), the excess supply of water is safely and cleanly stored for later usage when demand rate goes beyond supply (typically throughout the work day, though with some variations from morning to afternoon and evening).</p>
