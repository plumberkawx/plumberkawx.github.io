<p>Look for a jam. Something too hard to grind, such as a piece of glass, could be jamming the motor. Switch off the power and water, then disconnect the disposal (If it's hardwired, switch off the breaker.) Eliminate the rubber baffle inside the drain-most just lift out-and shine a flashlight into the hole. Fish out the blockage with a set of tongs or needle-nose pliers. For example, backflow can take place when there's a break in the main water line or when a fire hydrant is opened for use. Because pressure is lost throughout these events, water is no longer being pushed forward into your house and will stream backwards into the city water lines.</p>
