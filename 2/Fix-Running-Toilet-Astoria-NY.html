<p>Regenerate your softener with potassium chloride instead of sodium chloride (salt). Potassium chloride is available at most stores that sell softener salt. A single tank or cabinet-style system needs less space since the softener's brine tank nests inside of the salt tank.

A clogged drain can even result in slow water drainage, flooding, sewage backup, and costly repairs.</p>

Consumer Private investigator Jodi Brooks called around to attempt to get a price quote from personal plumbers for a waste disposal unit replacement. None of the businesses we called would offer a quote over the phone. All of them wanted to look at the situation before committing to a cost, and all wished to charge a service charge to come out. Brooks found only one plumber who would come out without charging.</p>
