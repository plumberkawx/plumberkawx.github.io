Many pipefitters, plumbers, and steamfitters discover their trade through a 4- or 5-year apprenticeship. Apprentices typically receive 2,000 hours of paid on-the-job training, in addition to some technical guideline, each year. Technical instruction consists of safety, local plumbing codes and regulations, and blueprint reading. Apprentices also study mathematics, applied physics, and chemistry. Apprenticeship programs are sponsored by unions, trade associations, and organisations. The majority of apprentices get in a program straight, however some start out as assistants or finish a pre-apprenticeship training programs in plumbing and other trades.</p>
