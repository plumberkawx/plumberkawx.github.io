This is a good time to include a shutoff valve next to the toilet or replace one that leakages. This is also a good time to replace the supply line that feeds your toilet (Photo 6). A flexible supply line enhanced with a metal sleeve costs about $7 in your home centers and hardware shops. Pictures 1 - 8 demonstrate how to replace the valve.
