<p>Soda dispensers (post-mix carbonators) use carbonated water mixed under pressure with syrup and water to supply soft drinks beverages. Many, if not most, water pipes are made from copper. When carbonated water enters into contact with copper it chemically dissolves the copper from the pipe. This copper-carbonate option (i.e. Carbonic Acid) has actually been proven to be a danger to the digestion system. The Universal Plumbing Code needs that the authorized backflow prevention for a post-mix carbonator be a reduced pressure backflow assembly (RPZ). Extra requirements: no piping including copper will be set up downstream of the RPZ backflow assemblies supplying carbonators.</p>
