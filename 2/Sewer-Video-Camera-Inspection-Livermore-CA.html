Plumber's putty can not be used on specific new sinks, however these will be labeled to that result. Utilize a non-water-based silicone if you can't use plumber's putty. Excess putty will squeeze out in between the new basket strainer and the sink when you tighten the locknut in location. Wipe it off with a rag or paper towel.
