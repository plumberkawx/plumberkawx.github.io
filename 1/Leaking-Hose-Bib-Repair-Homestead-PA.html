<p>Water that has been completely demineralized (such as RO and DI water) is starving for ions. This is what makes demineralized water-- or water in which all TDS have actually been removed-- destructive. For this factor, WQA suggests that common metal pipe and fittings (e.g., copper, galvanized, brass, bronze) ought to not be utilized downstream of a RO or DI treatment system. Softeners do not eliminate the TDS and do not trigger this type of rust A softener is simply capturing some cations (primarily calcium and magnesium) and releasing other cations while doing so (typically salt or in some cases potassium).</p>
