<p>Sediment Accumulation: If you notice strange popping, banging, or clanging noises originating from your unit, this might be an indicator that sediment has actually built up in your tank, and is causing a reaction with the heating component. Running out of warm water rapidly is another sign of sediment accumulation, because the sediment is taking up more area in the tank, so your water therefore takes longer to heat. To fix this problem, you will likely need to flush out the tank.</p>

<p>A brand-new pattern in re-piping is sand blasting the within used thin pipe and the painting the inside of the worn pipe with epoxy paint. Sometimes throughout the sandblasting the sandblasting will wear thin and blow through the wall of joints and pipes. Some of those thin areas leak immediately and sometimes those leaks come days or weeks later on. Leaking pipes that are epoxy-coated end up needing to be effectively re-piped by setting up a CDA copper re-pipe.</p>
