<p>Another downside of water softening through ion exchange is the prospective health danger for individuals on low salt diet plans. Ion exchange increases the amount of salt in water, in order to lower its mineral content. Normally, this procedure includes 7.5 milligrams of sodium per quart of water, depending on how difficult the water was to begin with. Harder water will lead to more salt, as there will be more sodium ions exchanged for mineral ions. For many people, this boost in salt is minor, but if you've been encouraged by a doctor to follow a stringent low salt diet this boost can position problems.</p>
