<p>How does ion exchange work? A chemical and physical process filters the water through an exchange media called resin or zeolite. Typically, the resin is a natural or artificial, sand-like product coated with positively charged sodium ions. As the calcium and magnesium dissolves into favorably charged ions, an ion exchange environment is produced. The water streams through the system while the resin launches its sodium ions and easily trades them for the calcium and magnesium ions. The water draining of the device is now considered soft.</p>

<p>Siphonage into a pipe system. When there is a reduction in provided pressure to the water circulation, occurs. The outcome is a backflow where liquid in the pipe section streams backwards relative to the direction of the system's water system movement. This opposite circulation is usually localized and can arise from a loss in upstream pressure from, for instance, physical failure of the pipe wall or its joints. Such physical damage is more common in smaller sized pipes based on automobile traffic on overlaying roadways, vibrations from surrounding heavy equipment operations, settlement of neighboring soil or moving foundations, the wear and tear of pipe appurtenances such as valves and meters, and so on. The outcome is a complete breakage, dislocation or breaking in the pipe that permits water to leave. Often no apparent physical damage to the pipe is required, simply the mechanical failure of a crucial pump whose shut down results in a substantial pressure drop across the pipe network.</p>
