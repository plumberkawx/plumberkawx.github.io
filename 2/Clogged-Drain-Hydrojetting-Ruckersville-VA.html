<h3>Best Plumbing Service Company In Ruckersville VA</h3>
<p>Often, an untrained individual will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the presumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair may be as basic as replacing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might require the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he creates information on the functions of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's duty to understand what the field test information implies for that particular assembly.  When a qualified tester interprets the data, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and needs repair.</p>
<p>The other difference between continuous feed and batch feed is that batch feed disposals only crush the food in batches (for this reason the name)-- not all at once like a continuous feed waste disposal unit.
