<p>To help avoid obstructions within the tee (an effect of the baffle inside ), some plumbers will connect the disposer discharge directly to the tee of an end-outlet continuous waste, instead of use the technique set out above. It's easy for waste from the disposer to clog it up due to the fact that the baffle effectively halves the interior size of the tee. This is specifically real when the waste needs to take a trip horizontally (down the arm) and after that change direction to drop the trap. Having the disposer discharge directly down into the tee allows for a direct line to the trap that's relatively friction-free. In this set-up, a waste arm runs in between the other sink drain and the tee.</p>
