<p>A partial reroute is basically a small scale repiping of several affected areas of the plumbing beneath the slab. In cases where jackhammering and fixing the pipe are not cost efficient, it is possible to just desert the afflicted section of pipe and reroute the line through the walls, ceilings and attics. Costing less than a full repipe, completion outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak again in the future. We have experienced homes having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can accumulate in cost extremely quickly. This is the main reason that we will advise a full repipe in certain communities, based on our experience.</p>
