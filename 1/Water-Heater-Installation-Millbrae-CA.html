<h3>Leak Detection Services: Leave It to the Millbrae CA Experts</h3>
<p>For a fire-sprinkler system to operate, the control valve or valves need to remain open and the system needs to be constantly kept track of. For that reason, there is a device on each control valve that either prevents the valve from being closed or sends an alarm when it is closed. This device can be as easy as a locked chain through the control valve that prevents that valve from opening, or an alarm system that alerts the fire department when the valve is closed. Some systems utilize both approaches. NFPA 13 refers to all such gadgets as supervisory devices.</p>
