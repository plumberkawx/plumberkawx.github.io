<p>Our kitchen sink clogged over the weekend.  Because I love to prepare, I create a lot of meals. We set up a temporary workaround at our visitor bathroom sink, however after a day of this we recognized that we required the sink fixed ASAP.  Fritz was in and out of the house within 30 minutes and he ensures that the sink will stay clog-free for 30 days. If it blocks once again within that time, he will come out and fix it for free - that is what I call service!  We are extremely delighted that we selected Fritz Drain Service to fix our kitchen sink and will definitely use this company once again and once again in the future.</p>
