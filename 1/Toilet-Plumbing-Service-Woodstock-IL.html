The brand-new inlets and outlets on the tank don't constantly line up with the old supply lines. Solder in a set of 45-degree fittings to offset each line if required.

Subsequently residential authorizations issued after that date require a testable backflow assembly for the fire sprinkler system. The assembly was tested at installation and a WSSC Water test tag with the date it was tested was attached. By code this backflow assembly must be tested annually. Likewise permits issued for sub-meters with backflow preventers for lawn irrigation systems need an each year test.
