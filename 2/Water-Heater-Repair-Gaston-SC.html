<p>Backflow preventers should only be repaired when the information gathered from the field test suggests the assembly has actually deteriorated in its performance listed below the established minimum standard. The test treatment is a diagnostic assessment of the operations of a backflow preventer. When the backflow preventer fails to fulfill this minimum standard, the backflow preventer must be repaired or if required, changed. These minimum requirements are set at a level that as the backflow prevention assembly starts to deteriorate in its performance, it can still prevent backflow. The purpose of a repair is to return the assembly back to its initial factory working requirements. This means the assembly is repaired so that it can perform above the minimum standard.</p>
