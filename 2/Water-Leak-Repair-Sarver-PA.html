<p>A double check backflow device (DC) is the most basic and most typical kind of device. It has 2 check valves in an entirely closed body-- 2 layers of backflow protection. No matter how large the valve is, all DCs are geared up with 1-pound springs that hold the check valves closed during a backflow scenario. When you eventually check a backflow preventer, those 1-pound springs are what you are testing. If each check valve holds a differential of 1 pound or more on your backflow gauge, the device passes. That suggests that the check valve is holding shut with at least 1 pound of force. The disadvantage of a DC is that if the first line of defense stops working and the second line of defense fails (both inspect valves fail to hold), a backflow situation could take place. That is why this kind of valve is not specified for what a public utility considers high risk" establishments.</p>
