Depending upon the length of time the water travels through the ground prior to reaching your tap, it can pick up a lot of these minerals, making water harder in some regions than others. While the minerals will not damage your health, they can leave insoluble mineral deposits, making the water unsuitable-- and rather a problem-- for its lots of desired uses around your home.</p>
