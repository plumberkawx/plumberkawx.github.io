<p>A partial reroute is generally a little scale repiping of one or more afflicted areas of the plumbing below the slab. In cases where jackhammering and fixing the pipe are not cost efficient, it is possible to only desert the afflicted section of pipe and reroute the line through the ceilings, walls and attics. Costing less than a complete repipe, completion result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak once again in the future. We have actually experienced homes having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can build up in cost extremely quickly. This is the main reason we will recommend a full repipe in certain neighborhoods, based upon our experience.</p>
