Turn on the gas and examine connections for leaks by brushing a 50-50 mixture of dishwashing liquid and water over the joints. You have a leak if the mixture bubbles.

<p>Backflow preventers should only be repaired when the information gathered from the field test indicates the assembly has actually degraded in its efficiency below the established minimum standard. The test procedure is a diagnostic examination of the operations of a backflow preventer. When the backflow preventer fails to satisfy this minimum standard, the backflow preventer must be repaired or if required, replaced. These minimum standards are set at a level that as the backflow prevention assembly begins to deteriorate in its performance, it can still avoid backflow. The purpose of a repair is to return the assembly back to its initial factory working specs. This implies the assembly is repaired so that it can perform above the minimum standard.</p>
