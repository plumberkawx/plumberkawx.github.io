The outcome is a backflow where liquid in the pipe segment streams in reverse relative to the direction of the system's water supply motion. This opposite circulation is typically localized and can arise from a loss in upstream pressure from, for example, physical failure of the pipe wall or its joints. Such physical damage is more typical in smaller pipes subject to lorry traffic on overlaying roadways, vibrations from surrounding heavy equipment operations, settlement of nearby soil or shifting foundations, the wear and tear of pipe appurtenances such as meters and valves, etc. The outcome is a complete damage, dislocation or splitting in the pipe that enables water to leave.
