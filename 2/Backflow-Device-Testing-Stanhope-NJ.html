The metal pipes are galvanized steel or iron, copper, and brass. The plastic pipes are Poly Vinyl Chloride PVC, Chlorine Poly Vinyl Chloride CPVC, Poly Ethylene PE, Polybutylene PB, and Kitec. The majority of these plastic pipe systems will end in claims. Part of the problem is with the fittings that are often inexpensively made with little quality assurance by a verity of abroad companies. Plastic pipes also have questionable joining techniques. Plastic pipes are glued, crimped, and banded. When plastic pipes blow a joint they blow apart and lead to water damage. Plastics end up being breakable with age and heat.
