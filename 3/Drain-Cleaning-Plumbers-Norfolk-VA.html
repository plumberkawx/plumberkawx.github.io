<p>The term tough water describes water with a high mineral content. These minerals can differ depending on which area of the country you remain in, but most typically include calcium, magnesium, bicarbonates, and sulfates. Difficult water does not start hard-- rather, it gets mineral deposits as it comes in contact with limestone underground. These mineral deposits stay when the water is routed into pipes for commercial and residential use, unless the water is softened or filtered.</p>
<p>The house still had lead pipes. Homes built in the very first part of the 1900s were plumbed utilizing lead pipes.
