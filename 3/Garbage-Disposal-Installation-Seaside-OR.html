<p>Current Review: Button Plumbing was excellent. They changed my kitchen faucet and included two new shut off valves under the sink which had constantly leaked in the previous if I turned off the water under the sink. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were really friendly and got the work done quickly. The price was quite reasonable. I will definitely utilize them for any future plumbing needs. I was incredibly delighted with their service.</p>
