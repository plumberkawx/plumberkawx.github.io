Ask how long the inspection generally takes when you call to arrange your consultation.</p>

<p>A freshly set up hot water heater should not produce strange noises, but it will start to produce rumbling sounds as it ages. The sounds get louder in time as the heater goes to heat up the water. Things aggravate significantly for homes with a high need for hot water. The factors for the sounds can be the accumulation of sediments in the tank which need to be flushed to restore normalcy. If the water heater still produces rumbling sounds even after it has actually been flushed, a water heater replacement may be required.</p>
