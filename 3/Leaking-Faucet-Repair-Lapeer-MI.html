It consists of an air inlet valve, check seat, and air inlet port.  In standard functional use, water pressure pushes the seat up and shuts off the air inlet.  When the water flow stops, it falls back down to open the air inlet port and breaks the vacuum, enabling the device to drain as well as preventing back siphonage.  The word siphonage" is very essential here.  This device just breaks the vacuum to drain water and will not secure versus back pressure.  Consider this device as a frost-proof hose bibb with a vacuum breaker.  It also has to be located a minimum of 6 inches above any overflow rim or downstream piping.</p>
