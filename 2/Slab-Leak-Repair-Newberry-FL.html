This is simply a non-mechanical pipe length forming a loop extending a minimum of 35 feet vertically above the water supply pipeline. The height is required to get rid of the ambient air pressure (at mean sea level) of 34 feet of head (14.6959 psi). A loop of pipe this high avoids a siphon from forming. Its advantages are the simpleness of its design and absence of moving parts. However, it might be not practical in many scenarios to install a pipe section of this length. Additionally, a barometric loop will not prevent back pressure from forming as the outcome of a pump failure.</p>
