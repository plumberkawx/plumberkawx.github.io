<p>Back-pressure is the reverse from regular flow instructions within a piping system as the outcome of the downstream pressure being higher than the supply pressure. This decrease in supply pressure occurs whenever the amount of water being utilized goes beyond the amount of water being provided (such as during water-line flushing, fire-fighting, or breaks in water mains).

Considering that the average life-span of a waste disposal unit is 12 years, you might wish to purchase a prolonged warranty.

To avoid more breakdowns, house owners need to keep up with regular maintenance of their waste disposal unit.</p>
