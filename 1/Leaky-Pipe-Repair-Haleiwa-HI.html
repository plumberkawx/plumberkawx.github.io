<h3>Choosing The Right Plumbing Service Haleiwa HI</h3>
<p>Salt-free systems will also minimize scale accumulation and offer brighter clothes and softer skin using a much healthier method. The main benefit with salt-free systems is the ability to soften water without having to add sodium to the water. This is a more heart environmentally friendly and healthy system. Standard salt-based systems add salt to the water which can have an unfavorable result on individuals with high-blood pressure and heart problem. Some cities are starting to prohibit salt-based softeners due to the high sodium content in the drainage. Salt-free systems are maintenance free and utilize no drainage, no electrical power and no salt or chemicals. In contrast to salt-based systems, salt-free systems are incredibly low maintenance because the media can last as much as 5 years without changing. Salt-based systems require the salt to be replenished on a regular monthly basis.</p>

When calcium and magnesium-- the solidity ions-- are collected by tiny resin beads through a procedure called ion exchange, water is softened. The resin beads are charged with salt or potassium ions. When difficult water comes in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are taken out of the water and changed with sodium or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
