Technical guideline consists of security, local plumbing codes and regulations, and blueprint reading. Apprentices also study mathematics, used physics, and chemistry.

<p>Reverse osmosis is the procedure used to purify water used for drinking and cooking. The water in our RO system goes through 3 phases. In the prefilter stage, large particles like silt and rust are removed by the filter. Next the water goes through the membrane. Hydrogen and oxygen pass through the pores while liquified solids are captured and gotten rid of. Lastly, the water goes to the holding tank after going through one last stage of filtration to get rid of any leftover pollutants.</p>
<p>If you choose to attempt this job yourself, be prepared to keep meticulous track of about a dozen tiny parts (put the stopper in the sink so none of them drop the drain).
