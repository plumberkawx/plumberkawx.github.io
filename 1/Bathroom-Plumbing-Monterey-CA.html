<p>I wanted to thank Clog Dawg Plumbing for the very best 1st experience with the start of our house enhancements. George and Anthony did a remarkable job for us.

<p>A double check backflow device (DC) is the simplest and most common type of device. It has two check valves in an entirely closed body-- two layers of backflow protection. No matter how big the valve is, all DCs are geared up with 1-pound springs that hold the check valves closed during a backflow scenario. When you eventually test a backflow preventer, those 1-pound springs are what you are testing. If each check valve holds a differential of 1 pound or more on your backflow gauge, the device passes. That suggests that the check valve is holding shut with at least 1 pound of force. The disadvantage of a DC is that if the very first line of defense fails and the 2nd line of defense fails (both check valves fail to hold), a backflow scenario might happen. That is why this type of valve is not defined for what a water company thinks about high threat" facilities.</p>
