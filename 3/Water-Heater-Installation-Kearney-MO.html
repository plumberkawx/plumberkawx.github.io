<p>A couple of local authorities require that the PVB be set up within 18 inches (450mm) of the connection to the water source, in which case you can't utilize a PVB unless the water source is at the luxury of the irrigated area. It may not be set up in any location where it might ever be immersed under water. Some towns do not enable the usage of PVBs with drip irrigation systems.
