<p>Often called an auger, this useful tool can clear clogs that may be stuck further down the system.

<h3>24 Hour Emergency Plumbing Services Concord NC</h3>
<p>In some cases, an inexperienced person will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the assumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair may be as simple as changing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might need the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he generates data on the functions of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's duty to know what the field test information suggests for that particular assembly.  When a qualified tester translates the data, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and needs repair.</p>
<p>On May 1st of 2007 WSSC Water embraced the International Plumbing and Fuel Gas Codes. Subsequently residential authorizations provided after that date need a testable backflow assembly for the fire sprinkler system. The assembly was tested at installation and a WSSC Water test tag with the date it was evaluated was connected. By code this backflow assembly need to be tested yearly. Likewise permits released for sub-meters with backflow preventers for yard irrigation systems require an each year test. It is required that this assembly is checked in the spring prior to running the watering system. All testable backflow preventers should be tested each year to guarantee the security of the safe and clean drinking water in your home.
