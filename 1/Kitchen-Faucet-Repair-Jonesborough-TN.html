<h3>How To Find The Best Plumbing Services Jonesborough TN</h3>
<p>Warning: If used on a water system where a pump and pressure tank supplies the water (like is used on a lot of rural homes that have a well), the PVB may spit water each time the pump shuts down. Since the pressure variations triggered by the pump and pressure tank system can cause backflow from the irrigation system back into the water system, this is. The probability of water spitting, and the amount of water that spits out, both boost with a longer mainline on the watering system. So if you have 10 feet (3m) of mainline between the PVB and the farthest valve there is less most likely to be water spitting than if you have 500 feet (150m) of mainline pipe. One way to stop, or at least decrease, this water spillage is to install a spring-loaded check valve right after the PVB. The PVB may still spill a little water with the check valve installed, however in many cases it should be much less water.</p>
