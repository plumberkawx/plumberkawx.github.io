The resulting soft water is more compatible with soap and extends the lifetime of some devices. Water softening is normally achieved using ion-exchange resins. The waste disposal unit is leaking from underneath your sink. Push the tip of a screwdriver up against the edge of the plug and tap up until you break out the plug.
