<p>An RP is a mechanical backflow preventer that includes two individually acting, spring-loaded check valves with a hydraulically operating, mechanically independent, spring-loaded pressure differential relief valve between the check valves and below the first check valve. It consists of shutoff valves at each end of the assembly and is equipped with test cocks.

<p>Another downside of water softening through ion exchange is the prospective health danger for individuals on low sodium diets. Ion exchange increases the quantity of salt in water, in order to reduce its mineral content.

Harder water will lead to more sodium, as there will be more salt ions exchanged for mineral ions. For many people, this boost in salt is minor, but if you've been encouraged by a medical professional to follow a stringent low salt diet plan this increase can position problems.</p>
