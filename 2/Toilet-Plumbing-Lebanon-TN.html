<p>Organic particles, such as grease, food, or hair stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is often the cause of clogged drains. The most typical way a plumber unblocks P-traps is with a tool referred to as a plumber's snake, drain or cable auger. The tool is carefully placed down your drain to clear it of buildup. You can attempt to do this yourself, however this isn't a beginner's Do It Yourself task. If you use the tool incorrectly, you can damage your pipes and trigger other leaks - so it's worth it to call someone who knows the drill.</p>

Today's high-efficiency softeners are altering the economics of water softening in the carwash industry.

<p>Often a clog can be triggered due to accumulation and grease within the system. If this is the case, snaking the drain will not fix the problem.

At the time of inspection, make sure to leave all of the gas piping exposed so the inspector can take a look at the entire system.</p>
