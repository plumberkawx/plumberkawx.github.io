<p>The extreme water conditions in Orlando and Central Florida are difficult on pipes. Over an amount of time the inside lining of the pipe will deteriorate and a small pinhole leak will develop. In some cases the option is to repair the broken section of pipe, and a spot repair is all that is required to fix the problem. Other times a more substantial service is needed: repiping. PVB assembles, intended for yard watering, are the least costly type of whole-system backflow preventer. They are reasonably easy in design and the easiest to install, keep, and repair.</p>

<p>Close all exterior doors and windows and switch on your bathroom and kitchen exhaust fans. Then open a close-by warm water faucet until you hear the burner in the hot water heater fire up. After a minute, move a cigarette smoking match around the edge of the draft hood (Photo 7) on top of the heater. The smoke should be drawn up the vent pipe. The fumes from the burner aren't venting if the smoke doesn't draw. Switch off the gas to the water heater and call a licensed plumber to correct the issue.</p>
