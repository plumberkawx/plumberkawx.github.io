Plumbing- If you are setting up a toilet in a new or renovated bathroom, installation may need plumbing modifications, which will increase your overall cost of installation.</p>
<p>Another downside of water softening through ion exchange is the prospective health danger for individuals on low sodium diet plans. Ion exchange increases the amount of sodium in water, in order to lower its mineral content. Usually, this process includes 7.5 milligrams of sodium per quart of water, depending on how hard the water was to start with. More difficult water will result in more salt, as there will be more sodium ions exchanged for mineral ions. For the majority of people, this increase in sodium is small, however if you've been recommended by a medical professional to follow a rigorous low salt diet this boost can pose problems.</p>
