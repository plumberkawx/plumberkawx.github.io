<p>, if you're tired of dealing with the side-effects of difficult water, a water softening system from RainSoft can supply you with the option you need. Ever since we first opened in 1953, our water softeners have made a difference in the lives of many house owners in The United States and Canada and around the globe. Our premium system, the EC4 whole home water softener, is a state-of-the-art product that uses a process of ion exchange to eliminate the minerals that trigger hard water. By replacing the calcium, magnesium, and bicarbonate ions that cause water hardness with salt or potassium ions, the EC4 softens tough water by addressing its source. Moreover, thanks to its distinct, integrated microprocessor, the EC4 system will discover your common water use patterns, adjusting its soft water delivery based upon your needs. In this way, our premium water softener makes sure that you'll have an endless supply of soft water whenever you need it.</p>
<p>This ion exchange process is assisted in by resin beads in the water softener that are charged with sodium ions. This is another combination that can deal with sink blockages. Mix about a cup of baking soda with a half-cup of salt, and put down the drain. Let the mix sit for several hours, then flush with boiling water. You can repeat this procedure if it doesn't work the first time. We do warm water heaters setups and repairs in Carmel, Fishers and Greenfield, IN, Indianapolis and the surrounding counties.</p>
<p>You must notice the difference in your house's plumbing immediately. The flow of water will come easier from faucets and water pressure will improve. Monthly water costs will improve also, and you can anticipate to need few to no repairs for leakages and blockages during the next couple of years.

Or perhaps you have actually had us replace your old kitchen sink and need a new disposal for it.

<p>During the regeneration cycle, brine (brackish water developed in the salt water tank by mixing water and salt) is gone through the resin tank (either up or down depending on the style). As this salt water goes through the tank, sodium ions are moved (exchanged) for the firmness ions on the exchange resin and these solidity ions are subsequently sent to drain. This process continues up until all the hardness ions are exchanged with the sodium ions (you'll discover percentages of salt going to drain together with the hardness ions) and the bed is considered totally regenerated.</p>
