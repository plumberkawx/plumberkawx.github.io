The beads end up being full of salt ions from the water softener salt when freshly regenerated. As difficult water passes through the water softener system, the calcium and magnesium ions are drawn in to the resin beads. There, salt ions are exchanged for the difficult water ions. The softener system then delivers soft water for your use. When water is heated up, tough water causes gray or white deposits. Water softening can be utilized to decrease these signs.</p>
