<h3>24 Hour Emergency Plumber In Wasco CA</h3>
<p>Jamming or Clogged: For the many part, a garbage disposal is only geared up to deal with softer natural waste. If bones or other hard foods get stuck in the disposal, it might cause it to jam and not work properly. By running hot water through the disposal, you may be able to clear the clog yourself. However you risk of harming the motor or blades. Usage of a camera in your sewer line can help us much better detect sewer backups and sewer line and drain problems.
