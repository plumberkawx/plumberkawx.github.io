<p>If you're purchasing a new toilet, you need to know the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the huge majority of toilets, the drain is focused about 12 in. from the wall. But with a couple of designs, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To examine the rough-in, simply determine from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. If that measurement (plus the thickness of the baseboard) isn't around 12 in., toilet shopping will be a bit harder. Most home centers carry only one or two 10-in. models and no 14-in. models. If you need to special-order a toilet, be prepared to invest a lot more. If there's a door near the toilet, also determine how far the bowl protrudes from the wall. If you are changing a toilet with a basic bowl with an elongated" design, the door may not close. Continue reading to discover how to install a toilet.</p>
