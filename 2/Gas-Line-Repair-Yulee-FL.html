<p>Organic debris, such as food, hair, or grease stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is typically the reason for clogged drains. The most common way a plumber unclogs P-traps is with a tool referred to as a plumber's drain, snake or cable auger. The tool is carefully inserted down your drain to clear it of accumulation.

If you use the tool incorrectly, you can harm your pipes and cause other leakages - so it's worth it to call somebody who knows the drill.</p>
