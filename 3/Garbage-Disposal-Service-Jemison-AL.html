<p>Are rust or minerals developing in your water? The two telltale signs of rust and mineral buildup are low water pressure and reddish-brown water coming out of the faucet. As rust or minerals build up over time, they gradually start to constrict the circulation of water, leading to low water pressure. It takes a long period of time for this much buildup to happen, so by the time you observe it, it may be time to repipe.
