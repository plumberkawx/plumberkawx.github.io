They do not have a lawn sprinkler, or any outdoor watering system at all, so they do not need backflow prevention. The main difference among water softener models remains in the way they schedule the backflush cycles. This is important because recharging the beads with salt prematurely wastes salt and water. Recharging too late causes performance to fall off.</p>
<h3>Water Heater Leaking in Newport Maine</h2>
<p>Hard water is softened by removing the calcium and magnesium it includes. When tough water passes through the softening system's resin bed, the calcium and magnesium (solidity) ions are removed through an ion exchange process, so just softened water travels through to your house. When the resin bed fills up with solidity ions, it needs to be regrowed (cleaned). Salt is normally used in the regeneration procedure and brings back the resin to a "clean" state so the ion exchange procedure can start again.</p>
