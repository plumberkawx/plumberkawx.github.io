<h3>How to Overcome Sink Drain Problems in Brookville OH</h3>
<p>For a fire-sprinkler system to operate, the control valve or valves should remain open and the system should be continually monitored. For that reason, there is a device on each control valve that either avoids the valve from being closed or sends out an alarm when it is closed. This device can be as basic as a locked chain through the control valve that prevents that valve from opening, or an alarm that notifies the fire department when the valve is closed. Some systems make use of both methods. NFPA 13 describes all such devices as supervisory devices.</p>
