<p>Recent Review: Button Plumbing was terrific. They replaced my kitchen faucet and included 2 brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had constantly leaked in the previous if I turned off the water under the sink. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining pipes slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were very friendly and got the work done quickly. The price was rather reasonable. I will definitely use them for any future plumbing requirements. I was very happy with their service.</p>
<p>To the end user (consumer), SpringWell Water (SpringWell") warrants that the following Covered products- retention tanks and mineral tanks (14" or bigger) will be devoid of any problems in product and craftsmanship for a period of 10-years under normal application, service and use. They were running a bit late due to earlier service calls, but I offer the company props for contacting us to update us on the later arrival time. Some jobs take longer than anticipated, that's easy to understand, by keeping us notified of the small delay, we didn't have to fret.</p>
