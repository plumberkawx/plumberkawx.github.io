Roto-Rooter's expert plumbers offer a complete range of basement plumbing services and drain cleaning services, however basement floor drain cleaning is one of the most common. To prep your unit for installation, you might have to attach a cable with a plug to reach the outlet, or extension wires to reach a hardwired box In this case, I attached a cord with a plug set that I purchased separately from the disposal system. It's as easy as feeding the wires from the cord through the disposal and attaching them to the matching colors on the system with wire nuts.</p>
