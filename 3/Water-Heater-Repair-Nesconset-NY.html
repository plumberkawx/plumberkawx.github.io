<p>While the "Big 4" - fill valve, flush valve, flapper, and journey lever - tend to be the main focus of the majority of repairs, there are plenty of other little toilet parts that need to also be well maintained to help prevent leakages and other toilet troubles. For example, if you have a two piece toilet, the tank to bowl gasket is your very first line of defense against leaks between the tank and bowl. As it gets used, it can begin to solidify and crack or just be so crushed that it doesn't fill the space in addition to it used to, and you end up with water all over the location. Similar to with the gasket, in some cases your tank to bowl washers and bolts can end up being rusty or so used that they spring a leak. We highly advise also replacing your gasket and your bolt set to make sure whatever is in tip-top shape Whenever you replace your flush valve.</p>
