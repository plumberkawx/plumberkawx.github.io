The softener replaces these ions with salt through a procedure called ion exchange.</p>
<p>Water softening is the elimination of calcium, magnesium, and particular other metal cations in hard water. The resulting soft water is more compatible with soap and extends the lifetime of some devices. Water softening is normally achieved using ion-exchange resins. The waste disposal unit is leaking from underneath your sink. Push the tip of a screwdriver up against the edge of the plug and tap up until you break out the plug.
