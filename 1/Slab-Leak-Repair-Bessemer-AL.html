<h3>24 Hour Emergency Plumbing Bessemer AL</h3>

<p>A partial reroute is basically a small scale repiping of one or more affected locations of the plumbing beneath the slab. In cases where fixing the pipe and jackhammering are not cost reliable, it is possible to only desert the afflicted section of pipe and reroute the line through the attics, ceilings and walls. Costing less than a full repipe, the end result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak once again in the future. We have experienced houses having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can build up in cost really quickly. This is the main reason why we will advise a full repipe in specific areas, based on our experience.</p>
