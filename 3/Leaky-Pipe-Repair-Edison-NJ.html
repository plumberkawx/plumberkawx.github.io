<p>Another downside of water softening through ion exchange is the possible health threat for people on low sodium diet plans. Ion exchange increases the quantity of sodium in water, in order to decrease its mineral material. Usually, this procedure includes 7.5 milligrams of salt per quart of water, depending on how hard the water was to begin with. More difficult water will lead to more sodium, as there will be more sodium ions exchanged for mineral ions. For the majority of people, this boost in salt is minor, but if you've been advised by a physician to follow a strict low sodium diet this increase can pose problems.</p>
