After an approval of plans has been issued and the assembly has actually been installed, it needs to be checked by a certified tester. The designer (or water supplier) is then responsible to accredit that the installation was performed in accordance with authorized strategies; or describe any changes or send "As Built" prepares as proper.</p>
<p>Your initial step is to shut down the water. In most cases, you'll have a shutoff valve right beside the toilet coming either through the floor or out of the wall. If you don't have a shutoff, switch off the water supply at the main shutoff valve, where water enters your home. This is a good time to include a shutoff valve next to the toilet or replace one that leakages. This is likewise a great time to replace the supply line that feeds your toilet (Photo 6). A flexible supply line reinforced with a metal sleeve costs about $7 in the house centers and hardware shops. Pictures 1 - 8 demonstrate how to replace the valve. If the height of your valve is adjustable, set the height before you install the valve (Image 5). Inspect the instructions if your valve is a various style from the one we reveal. After installing the valve (Image 6), link the fill tube (Image 7).</p>
