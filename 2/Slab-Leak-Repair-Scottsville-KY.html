<p>Difficult water is softened by removing the calcium and magnesium it consists of. When tough water passes through the softening system's resin bed, the calcium and magnesium (hardness) ions are eliminated through an ion exchange process, so just softened water travels through to your house. As soon as the resin bed fills up with firmness ions, it should be restored (cleaned). Salt is usually utilized in the regrowth process and brings back the resin to a "clean" state so the ion exchange process can start once again.</p>
