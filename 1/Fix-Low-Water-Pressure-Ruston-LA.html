<p>. Leaking Joints: The seals in between pipes have decomposed or broken, permitting water to get away into the ground surrounding the pipes. Evaluate the sewer lines from property to curb connection, sewage-disposal tank, and drainage systems to completely examine if pipe damage, rust, or major clogs exist.
