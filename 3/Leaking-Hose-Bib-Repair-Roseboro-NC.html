We've currently seen what these 2 terms share, so what's the distinction in between them? When it pertains to the problem of hard water, a traditional water softener really removes silica, magnesium and calcium ions, leaving it with small amounts of what is known as momentary firmness". The softener replaces these ions with salt through a process called ion exchange.</p>
<p>Another downside of water softening through ion exchange is the prospective health threat for individuals on low salt diets. Ion exchange increases the quantity of salt in water, in order to lower its mineral material. Normally, this process includes 7.5 milligrams of sodium per quart of water, depending upon how tough the water was to begin with. More difficult water will lead to more sodium, as there will be more sodium ions exchanged for mineral ions. For many people, this boost in sodium is minor, however if you have actually been advised by a medical professional to follow a strict low sodium diet this boost can pose problems.</p>
