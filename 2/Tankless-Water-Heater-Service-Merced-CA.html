When it concerns the issue of tough water, a conventional water softener actually gets rid of calcium, magnesium and silica ions, leaving it with little amounts of what is referred to as short-lived firmness". The softener replaces these ions with salt through a process called ion exchange.</p>
<p>Water that has been completely demineralized (such as RO and DI water) is hungry for ions. This is what makes demineralized water-- or water in which all TDS have actually been eliminated-- corrosive.

Softeners do not remove the TDS and do not trigger this kind of deterioration A softener is merely capturing some cations (primarily calcium and magnesium) and releasing other cations at the same time (usually sodium or sometimes potassium).</p>
