<p>Gas hot water heater are much easier to repair than electrical ones. A & frac13; HP or 1/2 HP waste disposal unit unit can grind soft, non-fibrous foods. There is really little insulation in the weaker designs. Plan to replace the water heater right away if you find a drip. Don't wait up until the leak gets bad. The cost to install a garbage disposal in Florida ranges anywhere from $325 to $1,000.
