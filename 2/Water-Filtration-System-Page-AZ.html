<p>To help avoid clogs within the tee (an effect of the baffle inside ), some plumbers will link the disposer discharge directly to the tee of an end-outlet continuous waste, instead of use the technique laid out above. Due to the fact that the baffle successfully halves the interior diameter of the tee, it's easy for waste from the disposer to clog it up. When the waste needs to travel horizontally (down the arm) and then change direction to fall down the trap, this is specifically real. Having the disposer discharge directly down into the tee enables a direct line to the trap that's relatively friction-free. In this set-up, a waste arm runs between the other sink drain and the tee.</p>
