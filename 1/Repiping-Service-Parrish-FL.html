Loosen up the two nuts that connect the tee to the tailpiece above and the trap listed below. Attempt decreasing the tee to see if the tailpiece is long enough. If it's not, you'll need to replace it with one that's somewhat longer.</p>

It consists of an air inlet valve, check seat, and air inlet port.  In standard functional use, water pressure pushes the seat up and shuts off the air inlet.  When the water flow stops, it falls back down to open the air inlet port and breaks the vacuum, enabling the device to drain along with preventing back siphonage.  The word siphonage" is very essential here.  This device only breaks the vacuum to drain water and will not protect versus back pressure.  Consider this device as a frost-proof hose bibb with a vacuum breaker.  It also has to lie at least 6 inches above any overflow rim or downstream piping.</p>
