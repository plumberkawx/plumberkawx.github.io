The relief valve will spring open if either check valve is clogged and wedged open by particles or if siphonage strikes the linked service pipeline. To prevent backflow, the downstream check valve will close. Such a reliable and advanced (if expensive) device is best utilized in important locations where cross contamination could be a direct risk to life and health.</p>
