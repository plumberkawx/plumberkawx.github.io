The outcome is a backflow where liquid in the pipe segment flows backwards relative to the instructions of the system's water system motion. This opposite flow is generally localized and can arise from a loss in upstream pressure from, for instance, physical failure of the pipe wall or its joints. Such physical damage is more common in smaller sized pipes based on lorry traffic on overlaying highways, vibrations from nearby heavy equipment operations, settlement of neighboring soil or moving structures, the wear and tear of pipe appurtenances such as valves and meters, etc. The result is a total breakage, dislocation or breaking in the pipe that allows water to escape.
