Even more, it should be set up in accordance with plumbing codes, producer specs, and engineering standards for the kind of system to be used.</p>
<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to standard softening systems. Instead of a large, single tank or twin alternating system that has actually been sized to manage peak circulation rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller sized tanks to efficiently get used to your business' flow rates throughout the day. Throughout periods of high circulation need, tanks come online to include flow rate capability. Throughout periods of low flow demand, tanks go off-line. This brand-new approach to softening is called responsive or progressive flow technology, and it's probably the most crucial development in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
