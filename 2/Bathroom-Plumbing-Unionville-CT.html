<p>Pipe Relining - This is a cost-effective option to repairing pipes.

<p>How does ion exchange work? A physical and chemical  process filters the water through an exchange media known as resin or zeolite. Normally, the resin is a synthetic or natural , sand-like material covered with positively charged sodium ions.

The water streams through the system while the resin releases its salt ions and easily trades them for the calcium and magnesium ions. The water draining of the device is now thought about soft.</p>
