<p>Your Local Plumbing, Heating & Cooling Specialists Because 1938. You'll observe the difference the very first time you shower or shower with softened water. Soft water feels significantly smooth to the skin. It also makes your house simple to clean by lowering hard-water build-up. High water pressure also harms plumbing. The water entering into the house puts excess pressure on faucet seal, water shut off valves and supply lines, and toilets. High water pressure causes leaks, running toilets and other plumbing problems that will continue to happen without appropriate pressure reduction.</p>

<p>In time, the resin beads in the water softener will end up being covered with calcium and magnesium ions, diminishing their capability to soften tough water. Through a process called regrowth, water is automatically flushed through the water softener with a focused amount of regenerant. Now the resin beads get the soft ions from the regenerant in exchange for the solidity on the beads. WaterBoss water softener systems feature a whole home water filtration with its trademarked self-cleaning dirt and sediment filter, so both the liquified rock and dirt and sediment are sent out down the drain. With the resin beads recharged," the water softener returns to service, supplying the whole home with clean, soft water.</p>
