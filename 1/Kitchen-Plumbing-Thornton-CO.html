<h3>What Causes Pipe and Drain Clogs in Thornton CO?</h3>
<p>Drip Leg - Any dust or grit in the gas line falls into this brief section of pipe before it can reach the water heater's control valve. The required length of the drip leg differs. Tankless units last 5-10 years longer than tanked systems and need fewer repairs in time. If you see your water is taking too long to get hot, or you are running out of hot water extremely rapidly, it is time to call a professional plumber for a hot water heater inspection. The California Contractors State Licensing Board (CSLB) requires licensed plumbers to renew their license every two years.</p>
<p>Running a gas line to a grill or fire pit costs $20 per foot, or $200 to $700 typically depending on the length from the main gas line. Installing a gas line for a grill costs $99 to $600, while a fire pit that's out in the lawn costs $300 to $1,400. You could have a problem with high water pressure if your water heater stops working due to sediment develop up in the tank. The water pressure builds and may eventually cause the tank to explode. This triggers thousands of dollars in water and property damage to your house.</p>
<p>You reside in an older home. There's a great possibility that you'll need to have it done soon if your house is 50 years old or older and you've never ever changed its pipes. Galvanized pipes were frequently installed in homes of this age, and these types of pipes are known to wear away and burst when they get old.
