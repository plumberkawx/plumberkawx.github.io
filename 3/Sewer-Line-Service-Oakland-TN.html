In cases where jackhammering and repairing the pipe are not cost efficient, it is possible to just desert the affected section of pipe and reroute the line through the attics, walls and ceilings. Costing less than a full repipe, the end result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak again in the future. We have experienced homes having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can accumulate in cost extremely quickly.
