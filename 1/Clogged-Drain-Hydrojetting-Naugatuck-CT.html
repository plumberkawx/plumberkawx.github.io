<p>Some manufacturers claim that the electrical gadgets they produce can affect the interaction of minerals with water so that the minerals do not bind to surface areas. Considering that these systems do not work by exchanging ions, like conventional water softeners do, one benefit declared for the user is the removal of the need to include salt to the system. While particle size decrease and plant growth promo have actually been claimed, such systems do not get rid of minerals from the water itself. Rather, they can only alter the downstream impacts that the mineral-bearing water would otherwise have.

Salt-free softeners are also known as water conditioners because they do not in fact soften" the water; They condition (or neutralize) it. And since these kinds of systems do not trap any minerals, there's no need for a cleaning cycle to eliminate caught ions.</p>
