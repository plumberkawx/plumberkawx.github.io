I in fact received their number for another company that could not come soon enough but referred me to Rate Buster's. Bo and company had the ability to come out within 12 hours to examine and offer me an estimate. They instantly cleared the initial obstruction, allowing for the renters to return from a hotel. Sadly, upon further investigation, there was a significant blockage that required excavation to investigate. His group was on website the really next day, a Saturday mind you, to start digging a 9 ′ hole. After repairing this preliminary problem and setting up a protective liner, it was determined that there was yet another break existed. This happened yet a 3rd time as they worked their way through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>

However it likewise could indicate that your tank welds or pipe fittings are worn. If this is the case, a plumber is required.
