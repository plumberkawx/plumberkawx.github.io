<p>A RainSoft water conditioner can assist your water heater last longer. Before salt starts working in a water softener it requires a little residence time within the tank, because the salt is liquifying gradually. When one immediately begins regeneration after adding salt to the reservoir, the water softener may not work according to requirements. After an approval of plans has been issued and the assembly has been set up, it needs to be evaluated by a certified tester. The designer (or water provider) is then accountable to certify that the installation was done in accordance with approved strategies; or describe any changes or send "As Constructed" plans as appropriate.</p>
