<p>Plastic pipe is an extensively used material because it is lightweight and flexible. Its seamlessness makes it an excellent material for installation in unsteady environments. Lightweight materials and compact construction devices reduce the cost of repair and decrease environmental damage. However, if your hot water heater is over 10 years and is constantly having problems, an entire unit replacement is the more economical alternative. It will be better to cope with a brand-new, more efficient unit than to invest in frequent repairs.</p>

<p>While the "Big 4" - fill valve, flush valve, flapper, and journey lever - tend to be the main focus of the majority of repairs, there are a lot of other small toilet parts that need to also be well preserved to help avoid leaks and other toilet troubles. For example, if you have a two piece toilet, the tank to bowl gasket is your first line of defense against leakages in between the tank and bowl. As it gets used, it can start to solidify and split or simply be so crushed that it doesn't fill the area along with it used to, and you wind up with water all over the place. Just like with the gasket, in some cases your tank to bowl bolts and washers can end up being rusty or so worn that they spring a leak. Whenever you replace your flush valve, we strongly recommend also changing your gasket and your bolt set to make certain everything is in good shape.</p>
