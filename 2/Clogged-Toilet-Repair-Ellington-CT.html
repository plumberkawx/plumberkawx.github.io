<p>A check backflow device (DC) is the simplest and most typical kind of device. It has 2 check valves in an entirely closed body-- two layers of backflow defense. No matter how large the valve is, all DCs are geared up with 1-pound springs that hold the check valves closed during a backflow situation. Those 1-pound springs are what you are testing when you ultimately evaluate a backflow preventer. The device passes if each check valve holds a differential of 1 pound or more on your backflow gauge. That implies that the check valve is holding shut with a minimum of 1 pound of force. The downside of a DC is that if the very first line of defense stops working and the 2nd line of defense stops working (both check valves fail to hold), a backflow situation could take place.
