<p>The other difference between continuous feed and batch feed is that batch feed disposals just squash the food in batches (hence the name)-- not all at once like a constant feed garbage disposal.

While gas leakages are unusual, you need to leave the structure right away if you discover a smell like rotten eggs in your residential or commercial property. A gas leak can have nearly immediate results on those exposed to it, and it can even be fatal. Get out of the house and call us instantly if you've got a gas pipe leaking.</p>
