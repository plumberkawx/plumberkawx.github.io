If it's too long, merely connect it to the disposal, mark it and suffice with a hacksaw for your garbage disposal installation. (Loosen the other pipe connections, if essential, to place the tube back into the tee.) You may have to make a time-wasting journey to the shop if the old discharge tube is too short.

You must also prevent using any type of chemical drain cleaners on your waste disposal unit since these chemicals will only damage the home appliance further.</p>
