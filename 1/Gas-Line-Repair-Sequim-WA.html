<p>Lubrication might help with the placement of some parts within the body of the backflow prevention assembly. Lubricant does not help the assembly work any much better, it is only there to help the specialist assemble the elements into the body without producing damage from friction. The lube should be a food grade lube to assure the water system is not infected. In a lot of cases the best lube is water. The typical use for lube in the repair procedure, is on 'rings (not guides). All 'rings must be gently oiled to assure they do not roll out of their retainer. Using too much lubricant can cause the backflow prevention assembly to fail or wear out quicker by drawing in dirt and debris or limiting the movement of the element. The appropriate amount of lubricant ought to make the surface of the 'ring appear damp. You need to never ever see pieces or globs of lubricant.</p>
