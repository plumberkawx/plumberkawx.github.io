<p>Our kitchen sink clogged over the weekend.  Considering that I love to cook, I create a whole lot of dishes. We set up a short-term workaround at our guest bathroom sink, but after a day of this we understood that we required the sink fixed ASAP.

If it obstructs again within that time, he will come out and fix it totally free - that is what I call service!
