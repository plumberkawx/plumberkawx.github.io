<p>Replace what's exposed. For a house with plaster walls, wood paneling, or other functions that make it hard to access to in-wall pipes, think about at least replacing pipes that aren't buried in the walls. Although it's a huge task, changing exposed pipes in a basement, crawlspace, or energy  room is fairly straightforward, because the plumber can quickly get at the pipes. This is a bad sign. Toilets must absolutely never wobble, shift, or wiggle. It's not you, and it's not something you're doing.

<p>A partial reroute is basically a small scale repiping of several afflicted areas of the plumbing below the slab. In cases where jackhammering and fixing the pipe are not cost effective, it is possible to just abandon the affected section of pipe and reroute the line through the attics, ceilings and walls. Costing less than a complete repipe, the end outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak once again in the future. We have experienced houses having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can accumulate in cost extremely quickly. This is the main reason we will recommend a complete repipe in particular neighborhoods, based on our experience.</p>
