<p>Siphonage into a pipe system. takes place when there is a decrease in supplied pressure to the water circulation. The result is a backflow where liquid in the pipe segment flows backwards relative to the direction of the system's water system movement. This opposite flow is typically localized and can arise from a loss in upstream pressure from, for instance, physical failure of the pipe wall or its joints. Such physical damage is more typical in smaller sized pipes subject to automobile traffic on overlaying highways, vibrations from adjacent heavy devices operations, settlement of neighboring soil or shifting foundations, the wear and tear of pipe appurtenances such as meters and valves, etc. The outcome is a complete breakage, dislocation or splitting in the pipe that allows water to escape. Sometimes no evident physical damage to the pipe is needed, simply the mechanical failure of a key pump whose shut down lead to a significant pressure drop across the pipe network.</p>
