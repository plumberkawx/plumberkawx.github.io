<h3>Plumbing Company Serving Freeport NY</h3>
<p>Warning: If utilized on a water supply where a pump and pressure tank provides the water (like is utilized on most rural homes that have a well), the PVB may spit water each time the pump shuts off. This is because the pressure variations brought on by the pump and pressure tank system can trigger backflow from the irrigation system back into the water system. The probability of water spitting, and the amount of water that spits out, both increase with a longer mainline on the irrigation system. So if you have 10 feet (3m) of mainline in between the PVB and the farthest valve there is less most likely to be water spitting than if you have 500 feet (150m) of mainline pipe. One method to stop, or at least decrease, this water spillage is to install a spring-loaded check valve right after the PVB. The PVB may still spill a little water with the check valve installed, nevertheless in most cases it ought to be much less water.</p>
<p>Another downside of water softening through ion exchange is the potential health risk for people on low sodium diet plans. Ion exchange increases the amount of salt in water, in order to reduce its mineral content. Typically, this procedure adds 7.5 milligrams of sodium per quart of water, depending on how hard the water was to begin with. More difficult water will lead to more salt, as there will be more sodium ions exchanged for mineral ions. For most people, this boost in salt is minor, however if you have actually been advised by a doctor to follow a rigorous low salt diet plan this increase can position problems.</p>
