<p>Siphonage into a pipe system. happens when there is a decline in supplied pressure to the water flow. The outcome is a backflow where liquid in the pipe sector flows in reverse relative to the direction of the system's supply of water movement. This opposite flow is generally localized and can arise from a loss in upstream pressure from, for example, physical failure of the pipe wall or its joints. Such physical damage is more common in smaller sized pipes subject to vehicle traffic on overlaying roads, vibrations from adjacent heavy devices operations, settlement of nearby soil or shifting structures, the wear and tear of pipe appurtenances such as meters and valves, etc. The result is a complete damage, dislocation or breaking in the pipe that permits water to escape. Often no obvious physical damage to the pipe is required, just the mechanical failure of a key pump whose closed down results in a considerable pressure drop across the pipe network.</p>
<p>Due to the fact that of the intrinsic style of a reduced pressure backflow assembly, varying supply pressure on an incredibly low flow or static flow condition may cause nuisance dripping and prospective fouling of the assembly. While ineffective in all cases, the installation of a soft seated check valve instantly ahead of the RPZ will typically hold the pressure continuous to the assembly in times of changing supply pressure.
