Rather than a large, single tank or twin alternating system that has actually been sized to manage peak flow rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller tanks to effectively get used to your company' flow rates throughout the day. Throughout durations of high flow demand, tanks come online to include circulation rate capacity. Throughout durations of low circulation need, tanks go off-line. This new method to softening is called responsive or progressive flow innovation, and it's arguably the most crucial development in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
