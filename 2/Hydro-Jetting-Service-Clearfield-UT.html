<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to traditional softening systems. Instead of a big, single tank or twin alternating system that has been sized to handle peak flow rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller sized tanks to efficiently adapt to your service' circulation rates throughout the day. Throughout periods of high circulation need, tanks come online to add flow rate capability. During durations of low circulation demand, tanks go off-line. This brand-new method to softening is called progressive or responsive circulation technology, and it's arguably the most important innovation in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
