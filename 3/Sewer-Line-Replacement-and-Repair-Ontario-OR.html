<p>Siphonage into a pipe system. When there is a decline in supplied pressure to the water circulation, takes place. The outcome is a backflow where liquid in the pipe segment streams in reverse relative to the direction of the system's water supply motion. This opposite flow is normally localized and can arise from a loss in upstream pressure from, for instance, physical failure of the pipe wall or its joints. Such physical damage is more common in smaller pipes subject to vehicle traffic on overlaying streets, vibrations from surrounding heavy equipment operations, settlement of nearby soil or shifting foundations, the wear and tear of pipe appurtenances such as valves and meters, and so on. The result is a complete damage, dislocation or breaking in the pipe that permits water to leave. In some cases no evident physical damage to the pipe is needed, simply the mechanical failure of a crucial pump whose shut down results in a significant pressure drop across the pipe network.</p>
