We've currently seen what these 2 terms have in common, so what's the distinction between them?

To prep your system for installation, you may have to connect a cable with a plug to reach the outlet, or extension wires to reach a hardwired box In this case, I connected a cord with a plug kit that I bought separately from the disposal system.

<p>Throughout the regrowth cycle, salt water (brackish water developed in the brine tank by mixing water and salt) is gone through the resin tank (either up or down depending upon the style).

This process continues till all the solidity ions are exchanged with the sodium ions (you'll see small amounts of salt going to drain together with the firmness ions) and the bed is considered completely restored.</p>
