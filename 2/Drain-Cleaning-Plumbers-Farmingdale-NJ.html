<p>Throughout the regeneration cycle, brine (brackish water produced in the salt water tank by mixing water and salt) is passed through the resin tank (either up or down depending upon the style). As this salt water travels through the tank, sodium ions are transferred (exchanged) for the hardness ions on the exchange resin and these hardness ions are subsequently sent to drain. This procedure continues till all the solidity ions are exchanged with the salt ions (you'll notice percentages of salt going to drain together with the solidity ions) and the bed is considered fully restored.</p>
