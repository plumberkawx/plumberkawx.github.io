Cracks in the Porcelain: Fractures in the toilet bowl can lead to bathroom flooding if not resolved quickly. Indications of distress in the porcelain consist of spider veins spreading throughout the bowl or base. It's an excellent idea to replace the system before it stops working.</p>
<p>Your first step is to shut down the water. In most cases, you'll have a shutoff valve right next to the toilet coming either through the floor or out of the wall. If you don't have a shutoff, switch off the supply of water at the main shutoff valve, where water enters your house. This is a great time to add a shutoff valve beside the toilet or replace one that leaks. This is likewise a great time to replace the supply line that feeds your toilet (Image 6). A flexible supply line strengthened with a metal sleeve costs about $7 in the house centers and hardware shops. Photos 1 - 8 demonstrate how to replace the valve. If the height of your valve is adjustable, set the height prior to you install the valve (Image 5). If your valve is a different style from the one we show, inspect the directions. After mounting the valve (Photo 6), connect the fill tube (Image 7).</p>

Furthermore, the longer you delay to call for professional assistance, the higher the possibility that you will have sewage back up in your pipes.</p>
