A downside of this device is that it's a lot more hard to unblock your toilet were to become clogged.</p>

Utilize a flat-blade screwdriver to pry the ring off, and eliminate the install ring and upper "protector" ring against the sink. The flange (and associated gasket, if appropriate) can now be popped out of the drain hole. Clean the area for the brand-new system.</p>
