Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he generates data on the functions of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's task to understand what the field test data means for that specific assembly.  When a trained tester translates the data, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and requires repair.</p>
