This is just a non-mechanical pipe length forming a loop extending a minimum of 35 feet vertically above the water system pipeline. The height is needed to overcome the ambient atmospheric pressure (at mean sea level) of 34 feet of head (14.6959 psi). A loop of pipe this high prevents a siphon from forming. Its benefits are the simpleness of its design and absence of moving parts. However, it may be unwise in lots of scenarios to install a pipe section of this length. Moreover, a barometric loop will not avoid back pressure from forming as the outcome of a pump failure.</p>

In the prefilter phase, big particles like silt and rust are gotten rid of by the filter. Next the water goes through the membrane.

Lastly, the water goes to the holding tank after going through one last phase of filtration to eliminate any leftover impurities.</p>
