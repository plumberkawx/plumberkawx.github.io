<p>A double check backflow device (DC) is the most basic and most common type of device. It has two check valves in a completely closed body-- 2 layers of backflow protection. No matter how large the valve is, all DCs are geared up with 1-pound springs that hold the check valves closed during a backflow situation. When you ultimately test a backflow preventer, those 1-pound springs are what you are testing. The device passes if each check valve holds a differential of 1 pound or more on your backflow gauge. That means that the check valve is holding shut with at least 1 pound of force. The disadvantage of a DC is that if the very first line of defense fails and the 2nd line of defense fails (both inspect valves stop working to hold), a backflow circumstance might occur. That is why this type of valve is not defined for what a water company thinks about high threat" establishments.</p>
