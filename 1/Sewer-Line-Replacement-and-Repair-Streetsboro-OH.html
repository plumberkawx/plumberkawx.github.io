<p>Polybutylene Pipe Repair & Replacement: Polybutylene pipe is gray plastic water supply line pipe that was established in the 1970s. It was in fact touted as the pipe of the future. It cost less than copper and was much easier to install. Unfortunately, any house that plumbed with polybutylene resembles a ticking time bomb. It is not a question of if it will leak, but when. A clogged or backed up drain pipe is an issue. Sometimes a house owner can unclog a drain with a commercial item or with a plunger. Sometimes unclogging a drain takes disassembling the plug and putting a hook to take out hair and gunk. And in some cases even then absolutely nothing gets that drain cleared, not even basing on one's head and murmuring necromancies to the drain gods.</p>
<p>Defective parts: If you have an electric water heater, a faulty thermostat or a tripped breaker can cause problems.
