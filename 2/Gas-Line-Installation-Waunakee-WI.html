<p>Recent Evaluation: Button Plumbing was great. They changed my kitchen faucet and added 2 new shut off valves under the sink which had always leaked in the previous if I turned off the water under the sink. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were really friendly and got the work done rapidly. The price was quite sensible. I will absolutely utilize them for any future plumbing needs. I was incredibly pleased with their service.</p>
<p>After removing standing water from the sink, pour about 1/2 cup of salt down the drain prior to you pour in the boiling water. Let it sit for a couple of minutes, and then flush with hot water to clear the mix. Have steel or iron piping and notice rust-colored water coming from your water devices? This is a great indication that your pipes may be rusting from the within and for that reason, need to be replaced. Keep in mind that if the rust-colored water just comes with hot water, the cause could be a rusted out water heater-- not your house's piping.</p>
