It makes more financial sense to replace your water heater if the cost of a repair is more than half the cost of a replacement at that point.</p>
<p>The normal service is to have the faulty pipes changed when you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes. Nevertheless, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes replaced: whole-house repiping. This is a choice to consider if you live in an older home (developed pre-1970) or any house with galvanized steel plumbing. Steel was the most popular option for house plumbing for lots of years, but steel ultimately struggles with corrosion and does not have the toughness these days's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>
