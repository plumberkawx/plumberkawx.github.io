<p>Storage centers and surge tanks are generally set up at the terminus of the water conveyance system, typically in between and aqueduct and the distribution water mains. These are centers developed for the short-term staging of water supplies and consist of water towers, tanks, tanks, secondary reservoirs, and lined ponds. These are best thought of as flow regulators instead of water storage units. Considering that water demand varies throughout the day while the pipe circulation rates from the water source remain approximately constant, usage never precisely matches supply. As so for those durations where water circulation is greater than need (generally night-time hours), the excess water system is securely and easily kept for later usage when demand rate exceeds supply (generally throughout the work day, though with some variations from morning to afternoon and night).</p>
