<h3>Plumbing And Remodeling Services Porter TX</h3>
<p>Polybutylene Pipe Repair & Replacement: Polybutylene pipe is gray plastic water system line pipe that was developed in the 1970s. It was in fact touted as the pipe of the future. It cost less than copper and was easier to install. Unfortunately, any home that plumbed with polybutylene resembles a ticking time bomb. It is not a concern of if it will leak, but when. A clogged or backed up drain pipe is an issue. In some cases a property owner can unclog a drain with a commercial item or with a plunger. In some cases unclogging a drain takes taking apart the plug and putting a hook to take out hair and gunk. And in some cases even then nothing gets that drain cleared, not even standing on one's head and muttering incantations to the drain gods.</p>
<p>Mice and rats are also the sort of unwelcome guests you can anticipate in your house if there are sewer line problems. It's easy for these furry rodents to make their way through cracks in plumbing. Like cockroaches and other unhygienic bugs, mice and rats carry disease and they can also aggravate asthma and allergies. If you start to hear the scurry of little animals, see evidence of mice or rats, or encounter the rodents themselves, these things could be an indication that you need a plumber to repair your sewer line.</p>
