<p>Reverse osmosis is the procedure used to purify water utilized for drinking and cooking. The water in our RO system goes through 3 stages. In the prefilter phase, large particles like silt and rust are gotten rid of by the filter. Next the water goes through the membrane. Hydrogen and oxygen pass through the pores while liquified solids are caught and removed. Lastly, the water goes to the holding tank after going through one last phase of filtration to eliminate any remaining contaminants.</p>
<p>On May 1st of 2007 WSSC Water adopted the International Plumbing and Fuel Gas Codes. Subsequently residential permits issued after that date need a testable backflow assembly for the fire lawn sprinkler. The assembly was tested at installation and a WSSC Water test tag with the date it was tested was connected. By code this backflow assembly should be checked annually. Also permits released for sub-meters with backflow preventers for yard irrigation systems need an each year test. It is required that this assembly is tested in the spring before operating the watering system. All testable backflow preventers need to be checked every year to insure the safety of the safe and clean drinking water in your house.
