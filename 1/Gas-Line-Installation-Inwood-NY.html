<p>Iron fouling is another typical maintenance problem for water softeners. Although colorless, reduced iron will be removed by the unit, red-oxidized iron (iron that has actually been exposed to air or chlorine) will clog the resin. Filtration prior to softening guarantees that oxidized iron is not processed in the softener. If the resin has actually already been fouled, commercial cleaners are available. Again, it is recommended to examine the manufacturer's instructions for unique safety measures.</p>
