<p><img src="https://plumbingimages.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/plumbing.jpg" alt=""><p>
<p>Video cameras are among the most important tools in the plumbing business. A. Normally wax does not "go bad" on a basic floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to avoid leakages. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to prevent smells. If you are experiencing a leak originating from beneath the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or complete blown) toilet blockage down the drain line (or the toilet is broken in the bowl). Also, make sure the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "common" unnoticed issue. Attempt putting a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>
<p>Preferably, you'll never discover the need for water or waste line repairs in your home. You certainly do not need us to inform you, however, that we are not residing in an ideal world.

The longer that you wait to do so, the most likely you will encounter comprehensive damage to your house. Keep in mind of any inexplicable drop in your water pressure, the sound of running water when none is in use, moldy smells, or early signs of water damage. We'll examine matters, and complete any piping repairs that may be required.</p>
