<p>During the regeneration cycle, brine (brackish water developed in the brine tank by blending water and salt) is travelled through the resin tank (either up or down depending upon the design). As this salt water goes through the tank, salt ions are moved (exchanged) for the solidity ions on the exchange resin and these firmness ions are consequently sent out to drain. This process continues until all the hardness ions are exchanged with the sodium ions (you'll see percentages of salt going to drain together with the hardness ions) and the bed is considered fully regenerated.</p>
