<h3>Types Of Blocked Drain Cleaning Equipment in Congers NY</h3>
<p>Search for a jam. Something too difficult to grind, such as a piece of glass, could be jamming the motor. Turn off the power and water, then disconnect the disposal (If it's hardwired, shut off the breaker.) Eliminate the rubber baffle inside the drain-most simply lift out-and shine a flashlight into the hole. Fish out the blockage with a set of tongs or needle-nose pliers. For example, backflow can happen when there's a break in the main water line or when a fire hydrant is opened for use. Since pressure is lost throughout these events, water is no longer being pushed forward into your home and will stream backwards into the city water lines.</p>
