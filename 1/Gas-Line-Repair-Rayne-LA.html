<p>Are rust or minerals building up in your water? The 2 indicators of rust and mineral buildup are low water pressure and reddish-brown water coming out of the faucet. As rust or minerals collect with time, they slowly start to restrict the flow of water, resulting in low water pressure. It takes a long period of time for this much accumulation to occur, so by the time you discover it, it may be time to repipe. Red or brown water results when littles rust break off from the pipes into your water supply, impacting your water quality.</p>
