Bo and company were able to come out within 12 hours to investigate and offer me a price quote. They right away cleared the preliminary blockage, enabling the renters to return from a hotel. Unfortunately, upon additional examination, there was a significant clog that needed excavation to investigate. His team was on website the very next day, a Saturday mind you, to start digging a 9 ′ hole.
