<p>A check backflow device (DC) is the most basic and most common type of device. It has two check valves in an entirely closed body-- two layers of backflow protection. No matter how large the valve is, all DCs are equipped with 1-pound springs that hold the check valves closed during a backflow scenario. Those 1-pound springs are what you are testing when you eventually test a backflow preventer. The device passes if each check valve holds a differential of 1 pound or more on your backflow gauge. That suggests that the check valve is holding shut with at least 1 pound of force. The drawback of a DC is that if the first line of defense stops working and the second line of defense stops working (both inspect valves stop working to hold), a backflow circumstance might take place. That is why this kind of valve is not specified for what a water company thinks about high risk" establishments.</p>
