Plumbing codes mandate that potable water products be protected versus backflow at all cross-connections. We provide the largest selection of backflow prevention solutions for any application.</p>
<p>Those of us in the industry know that cross-connection programs in many areas have actually greatly lowered the number of reported occurrences that occur within our water systems. This has at times resulted in people thinking that backflow problems and problems no longer exist or that there may never really have been a problem in the first place. This thinking can be both counterproductive and harmful. Backflow events in water supply are a result of modifications in pressure within that system.  Every system may not need a reduced pressure principle backflow assembly.  In far a lot of areas we have an all or nothing approach to backflow protection. We need to look at each installation for the danger it presents and after that install the proper defense.</p>
