<p>A double check backflow device (DC) is the simplest and most common type of device. It has two check valves in a totally closed body-- two layers of backflow protection. No matter how large the valve is, all DCs are equipped with 1-pound springs that hold the check valves closed throughout a backflow scenario. Those 1-pound springs are what you are testing when you ultimately test a backflow preventer. The device passes if each check valve holds a differential of 1 pound or more on your backflow gauge. That means that the check valve is holding shut with at least 1 pound of force. The disadvantage of a DC is that if the very first line of defense fails and the 2nd line of defense stops working (both examine valves fail to hold), a backflow situation could happen. That is why this kind of valve is not specified for what a water company thinks about high danger" facilities.</p>
