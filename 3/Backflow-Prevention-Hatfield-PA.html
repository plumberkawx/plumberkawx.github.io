As water trickles through rocks, limestone deposits and soil, it picks up these minerals on its journey. Depending on the length of time the water travels through the ground before reaching your tap, it can pick up a lot of these minerals, making water harder in some areas than others. While the minerals will not damage your health, they can leave insoluble mineral deposits, making the water inappropriate-- and quite a problem-- for its numerous desired uses around your home.</p>
