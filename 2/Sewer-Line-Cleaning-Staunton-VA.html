<p>What is difficult water? Scientifically speaking, it is water which contains considerable amounts of liquified minerals, specifically calcium and magnesium. As water trickles through rocks, limestone deposits and soil, it gets these minerals on its journey. Depending on how long the water takes a trip through the ground before reaching your tap, it can get a lot of these minerals, making water harder in some regions than others. While the minerals won't hurt your health, they can leave insoluble mineral deposits, making the water unsuitable-- and quite a nuisance-- for its many designated uses around your house.</p>

All the products will restore the interior of your pipes without needing to totally replace them. How old is the plumbing in your house? Well, first let's ask you a various question: How old is your house? If it was constructed before 1970, it might have pipes made from an out-of-date product that will start to provide you problems in the not-too-distant future (if they haven't already).

More recent units utilize electronic sensors that monitor bead depletion and other essential metrics based on your water usage and for that reason only regrow when needed. These newer systems, also referred to as demand-initiated regeneration softeners, are perfect due to the fact that they save energy and cash-- utilizing less water and salt for regrowth.</p>
