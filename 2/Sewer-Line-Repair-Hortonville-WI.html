<p>On May 1st of 2007 WSSC Water embraced the International Plumbing and Fuel Gas Codes. Subsequently residential permits released after that date require a testable backflow assembly for the fire lawn sprinkler. The assembly was checked at installation and a WSSC Water test tag with the date it was evaluated was attached. By code this backflow assembly should be evaluated every year. Also permits provided for sub-meters with backflow preventers for yard irrigation systems require an annually test. It is needed that this assembly is checked in the spring prior to running the watering system. All testable backflow preventers should be evaluated annually to guarantee the security of the safe and clean drinking water in your home.
