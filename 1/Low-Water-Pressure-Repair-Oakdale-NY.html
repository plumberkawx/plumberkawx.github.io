<p>If you're purchasing a brand-new toilet, you need to understand the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the large majority of toilets, the drain is centered about 12 in. from the wall. But with a few models, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To inspect the rough-in, simply measure from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. Toilet shopping will be a bit harder if that measurement (plus the thickness of the baseboard) isn't approximately 12 in.. Most home centers bring just one or two 10-in. models and no 14-in. designs. If you have to special-order a toilet, be prepared to invest much more. If there's a door near the toilet, also measure how far the bowl protrudes from the wall. If you are replacing a toilet with a basic bowl with an elongated" design, the door may not close. Read on to discover how to install a toilet.</p>
