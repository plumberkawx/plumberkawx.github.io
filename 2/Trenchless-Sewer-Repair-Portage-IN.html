Conventional salt-based systems include salt to the water which can have a negative impact on individuals with high-blood pressure and cardiovascular disease. Some cities are starting to ban salt-based softeners due to the high salt content in the waste water. Salt-free systems are maintenance totally free and utilize no drainage, no electricity and no salt or chemicals. In comparison to salt-based systems, salt-free systems are exceptionally low maintenance due to the fact that the media can last approximately five years without changing. Salt-based systems require the salt to be renewed on a month-to-month basis.</p>
