<p>Do you notice that you have dry or flaky skin, or does your water have a chemical or rotten egg odor? It most likely goes without stating that leaking pipes should be changed immediately. It might be normal to have condensation on warm water pipes, but it's certainly not typical for your pipes to spring a leak. A garbage disposal can lower a home's total garbage output by pulverizing most typical food scraps so they can be eliminated through the sink as wastewater. A waste disposal unit fits practically perfectly into the sink, and can be kept by simply disposing of a few ice cubes and some baking soda once a month to sharpen the blades and minimize unpleasant odors.</p>
<p>Line up the rubber seal ring on the top of the disposer with the flange below the sink. Press it into place, and loosely secure it by turning the lower mounting ring onto the ramp tabs of the upper installing ring. Rotate disposer unit as required to align drain assembly. There's a nasty smell coming from your drains - You might not see this right now, however foul odors mean whatever is stuck in your drains-- most likely food waste-- is decomposing in there. If you can smell it, it's time to unclog.</p>
