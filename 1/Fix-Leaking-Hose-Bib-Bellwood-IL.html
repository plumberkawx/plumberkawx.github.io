<p>For a fire-sprinkler system to run, the control valve or valves need to stay open and the system should be continuously kept an eye on. Therefore, there is a device on each control valve that either avoids the valve from being closed or sends out an alarm when it is closed. This device can be as easy as a locked chain through the control valve that avoids that valve from opening, or an alarm that informs the fire department when the valve is closed. Some systems use both techniques. NFPA 13 describes all such gadgets as supervisory devices.</p>
