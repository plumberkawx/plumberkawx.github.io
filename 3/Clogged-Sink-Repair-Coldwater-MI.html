<p>Siphonage into a pipe system. When there is a decrease in supplied pressure to the water flow, happens. The outcome is a backflow where liquid in the pipe section flows in reverse relative to the direction of the system's supply of water movement. This opposite flow is generally localized and can result from a loss in upstream pressure from, for example, physical failure of the pipe wall or its joints. Such physical damage is more typical in smaller sized pipes based on car traffic on overlaying streets, vibrations from surrounding heavy devices operations, settlement of neighboring soil or moving foundations, the wear and tear of pipe appurtenances such as meters and valves, and so on. The outcome is a total damage, dislocation or cracking in the pipe that allows water to leave. Sometimes no apparent physical damage to the pipe is required, just the mechanical failure of a crucial pump whose shut down results in a substantial pressure drop across the pipe network.</p>
<p>A. If you have rust spots, using phosphoric acid typically will assist remove them. If you wish to try the gentlest method perhaps try using some Coke on the rust initially.  No, we aren't joking, Coca-Cola consists of a trace amount of phosphoric acid. To try this, drain the toilet bowl to listed below where the rust marks are. Then pour on some Coke. Wipe with a soft fabric and after that more Coke, over and over, etc. If that does not work then use Naval Jelly which consists of a lot more phosphoric acid (make sure to read the instructions and security cautions first!). Naval Jelly is what we here at Â® use to get rid of rust stains and it's easily offered at many hardware shops.</p>
