Costing less than a complete repipe, the end outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak once again in the future. We have actually experienced homes having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can accumulate in cost very rapidly.

<p>A water softener has a resin tank containing thousands of small resin beads that hold electrically charged ions. When freshly restored, the beads end up being filled with salt ions from the water softener salt. As tough water travels through the water softener system, the calcium and magnesium ions are attracted to the resin beads. There, salt ions are exchanged for the tough water ions. The softener system then delivers soft water for your usage. Tough water causes white or gray deposits when water is heated. Water softening can be utilized to decrease these symptoms.</p>
<p>A decrease in supply side pressure brought on by an occurrence such as a water pipe break, or a heavy water demand from activities such as fire battling, causes the supply pressure to drop below the customer side pressure. A fouled # 2 Inspect Valve enables the excess consumer side pressure to act on the Relief Valve Diaphram, opening the Relief Valve discharge. Water will discharge until the supply side pressure once again exceeds the consumer side pressure and closes the Relief Valve or until the shut-off valves are closed.</p>
