Several hot water heater manufacturers advise that you flush your water heater a minimum of once a year to reduce the build-up of minerals. If the hot water heater is leaking from the bottom of the tank, that is an indicator the tank is failing and will need to be replaced. Schedule a quote as soon as possible and make sure nothing is near the heater that might be potentially harmed if it is in a garage and a little slow leak. Leaking hot water heater can burst causing water damage and flooding of houses.</p>

To prep your system for installation, you might have to attach a cord with a plug to reach the outlet, or extension wires to reach a hardwired box In this case, I connected a cable with a plug kit that I purchased individually from the disposal system. It's as simple as feeding the wires from the cord through the disposal and connecting them to the matching colors on the system with wire nuts.</p>
<p>After getting rid of standing water from the sink, put about 1/2 cup of salt down the drain before you gather the boiling water. Let it sit for a couple of minutes, and then flush with hot water to clear the mixture. Have steel or iron piping and notice rust-colored water originating from your water home appliances? This is an excellent indication that your pipes might be rusting from the within and therefore, need to be changed. Keep in mind that if the rust-colored water just comes with hot water, the cause might be a rusted out hot water heater-- not your home's piping.</p>
