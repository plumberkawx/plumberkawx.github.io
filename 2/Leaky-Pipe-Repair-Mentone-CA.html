To fix this problem, you will likely need to eliminate the tank.</p>
<p>Standpipe systems are used in lots of centers, these systems are developed to provide water to fire hose connections or hose cabinets tactically set up inside a structure.

Standpipe systems can offer early fire suppression in these buildings making it capable for a single person or firemen to offer a effective and fast response to fire.
