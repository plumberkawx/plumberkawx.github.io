<p>A double check backflow device (DC) is the most basic and most typical type of device. It has two check valves in a completely closed body-- 2 layers of backflow defense. No matter how large the valve is, all DCs are equipped with 1-pound springs that hold the check valves closed during a backflow scenario. Those 1-pound springs are what you are testing when you ultimately check a backflow preventer. If each check valve holds a differential of 1 pound or more on your backflow gauge, the device passes. That means that the check valve is holding shut with a minimum of 1 pound of force. The drawback of a DC is that if the first line of defense stops working and the 2nd line of defense fails (both examine valves stop working to hold), a backflow circumstance could take place. That is why this kind of valve is not defined for what a water company thinks about high danger" establishments.</p>
