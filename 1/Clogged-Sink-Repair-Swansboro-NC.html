<p>During typical operation, the pressure between the two check valves, described as the zone of reduced pressure, is maintained at a lower pressure than the supply pressure. The relief valve is created to discharge and open water to the outside if either check valve must leak. An RPZ will occasionally discharge percentages of water due to change in line pressure up or downstream of the assembly. For this factor, the RPZ needs to be set up in locations that are not subject to water damage and enable adequate drainage.</p>
