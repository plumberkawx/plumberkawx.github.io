<p>Replace what's exposed. For a house with plaster walls, wood paneling, or other features that make it tough to gain access to in-wall pipes, consider a minimum of replacing pipes that aren't buried in the walls.

Toilets should absolutely never ever wobble, move, or wiggle. It's not you, and it's not something you're doing.
