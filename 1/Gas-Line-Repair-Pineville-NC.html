<p>Recent Evaluation: Button Plumbing was fantastic. They replaced my kitchen faucet and included 2 brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had always dripped in the past if I turned off the water under the sink. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were very friendly and got the work done quickly. The rate was rather affordable. I will absolutely use them for any future plumbing needs. I was extremely delighted with their service.</p>
<p>Foul Sewer Odor: One of the very first most apparent signs of a sewer problem is a smell of sewage when you flush the toilet, or in the yard (in the area where your sewer line would be). This can be an easy problem such as a broken water seal, or it can indicate a larger concern such as a broken sewer pipe. Regardless of whether it is an electric water heater or a gas hot water heater, Premier Plumbing has offered water heater repair and installation service in the Hampton Roadways area since 1978.</p>
