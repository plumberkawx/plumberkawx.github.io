These are certainly priorities for a municipality and its locals but hard water can negatively impact faucets and home appliances in a house. With the high calcium content of local water, it can trigger a dishwasher or hot water heater to breakdown. You might be better off repiping if the problem is repeating or the damage is substantial.
