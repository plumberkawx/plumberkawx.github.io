Gas lines which are versatile are prone to crimping and leaking, others made from inappropriate, low-grade material likewise become fragile quickly and rust away, causing an extreme leak.

<p>Your sewer line issue can result in sewer backups, and they usually occur in the lowest open drain. This kind of issue is usually the result of an obstruction in the line. If you don't detect the smell coming from the sewer backup, you may identify this issue because a backup happens whenever you flush the toilet or run water in your bathtub or sink. Every drain in your house depends on the main sewer line for proper drainage. If, however, only one drain has backup problems, there's an isolated problem with only that drain, which is not most likely to be a sewage problem.</p>
