<h3>How to Repair Kitchen Faucets in Berkeley CA</h3>
<p>Search for a jam. Something too difficult to grind, such as a piece of glass, could be jamming the motor. Turn off the power and water, then unplug the disposal (If it's hardwired, shut off the breaker.) Get rid of the rubber baffle inside the drain-most just raise out-and shine a flashlight into the hole. Fish out the obstruction with a set of tongs or needle-nose pliers.
