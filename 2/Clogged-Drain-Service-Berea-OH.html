<p>A decrease in supply side pressure brought on by an incident such as a water main break, or a heavy water need from activities such as fire fighting, triggers the supply pressure to drop below the customer side pressure. A fouled # 2 Check Valve permits the excess customer side pressure to act on the Relief Valve Diaphram, opening the Relief Valve discharge. Water will discharge until the supply side pressure once again exceeds the consumer side pressure and closes the Relief Valve or till the shut-off valves are closed.</p>
<p>Often a clog can be triggered due to buildup and grease within the system. Snaking the drain will not fix the issue if this is the case. You might need to check out utilizing a high pressure water system to eliminate the clog. This procedure is a bit more expensive and will cost anywhere from $400-$ 1000, depending upon the severity of the clog. At the time of inspection, be sure to leave all of the gas piping exposed so the inspector can take a look at the whole system.</p>
