To prevent such an incident, there needs to be some type of backflow prevention method used. The very best and most safe type of backflow prevention is an air space (a physical separation between the water outlet and the rim of the component). If an air gap is not possible, then the correct backflow prevention device is needed. This backflow device is thought about a containment" backflow preventer and is regulated by the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency and your water provider.</p>
