<p>Spotty meals? Due to the fact that a toilet is still operating and has not become completely disabled does not imply that it might not still need to be fixed, just.

It helps to know the brand name and design of your toilet. The brand name is typically on the bowl behind the seat. Sometimes, the model or number will be on the underside of the lid or inside the tank. Matching an unusual flapper can end up being a trial-and-error process. Even professional plumbers in some cases try two or three flappers before they discover one that works well.</p>
