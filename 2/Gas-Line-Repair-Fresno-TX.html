In cases where jackhammering and fixing the pipe are not cost reliable, it is possible to only desert the afflicted area of pipe and reroute the line through the ceilings, walls and attics. Costing less than a complete repipe, the end outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak again in the future. We have experienced houses having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can add up in cost very rapidly. This is the main reason that we will suggest a complete repipe in certain neighborhoods, based upon our experience.</p>
