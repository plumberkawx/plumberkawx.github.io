Such physical damage is more common in smaller pipes subject to vehicle traffic on overlaying roadways, vibrations from nearby heavy devices operations, settlement of close-by soil or moving structures, the wear and tear of pipe appurtenances such as meters and valves, and so on. The outcome is a complete breakage, dislocation or breaking in the pipe that enables water to leave.
