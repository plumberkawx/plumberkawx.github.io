<p>Replacing the ring that seals the connection between the sewer and the bowl line implies completely eliminating the whole toilet. So it's a. good time to consider getting a brand name brand-new toilet. A toilet auger works the opposite way that a plunger does. Instead of removing the obstruction with negative pressure, it in fact pushes into the obstruction, working even more into where the blockage is occurring.
