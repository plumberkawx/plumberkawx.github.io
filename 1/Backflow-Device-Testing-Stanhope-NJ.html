<p>Another drawback of water softening through ion exchange is the potential health danger for individuals on low sodium diets. Ion exchange increases the quantity of sodium in water, in order to reduce its mineral material. Generally, this procedure includes 7.5 milligrams of sodium per quart of water, depending on how tough the water was to start with. Harder water will result in more sodium, as there will be more sodium ions exchanged for mineral ions. For many people, this increase in sodium is minor, however if you've been recommended by a doctor to follow a stringent low salt diet plan this boost can pose problems.</p>
