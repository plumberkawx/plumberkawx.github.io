<p>Siphonage into a pipe system. happens when there is a decline in provided pressure to the water circulation. The outcome is a backflow where liquid in the pipe sector flows backwards relative to the instructions of the system's water supply movement. This opposite circulation is generally localized and can result from a loss in upstream pressure from, for instance, physical failure of the pipe wall or its joints. Such physical damage is more common in smaller sized pipes based on vehicle traffic on overlaying streets, vibrations from nearby heavy equipment operations, settlement of nearby soil or moving foundations, the wear and tear of pipe appurtenances such as meters and valves, etc. The result is a total breakage, dislocation or breaking in the pipe that permits water to leave. In some cases no obvious physical damage to the pipe is needed, simply the mechanical failure of a crucial pump whose closed down results in a substantial pressure drop throughout the pipe network.</p>
